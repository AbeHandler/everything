    "You can drive home via the highway or by taking local roads. \n",

    "If you drive on the highway, and there is no traffic, you can get home in 30 minutes. But if there is a road accident on the highway there will be severe traffic and it will take you 90 minutes to get home. Every time you take the highway, there is a 10% chance that a road accident will cause severe traffic. You can assume you always get home in 30 or 90 minutes, if you drive on the highway. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you drive on local roads, they are more predictable than the highway. On local roads, there is a probability of .95 that it will take you 40 minutes to get home. However, with probability .05 there will be construction on the local roads, which will case traffic. If there is traffic, you will get home in 45 minutes due to delays. You can assume you always get home in 40 or 45 minutes, if you drive on local roads. "
