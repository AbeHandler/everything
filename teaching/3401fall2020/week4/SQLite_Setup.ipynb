    "In this notebook, you will get setup with SQLite. But before going through the steps to get things running, it is worth pointing out that there are lots and lots of different kinds of databases. We just picked SQLite for this assignment set because it is easy to get working. In your career in information science, you will have many database choices. \n",
    "\n",
    "Postgres and MySQL are standard, established and popular open-source, relational databases. Postgres in particular is a great choice for a reliable and performant database to support many applications (beware, Postgres can be slightly annoying to set up). Beyond reliable favorites like Postgres and MySQL, there are lots and lots of other kinds of databases, which fill different software niches and use cases. For instance, standard databases store records on disk, but VoltDB stores records in memory. Some databases like Oracle (expensive, “enterprise” software) might support complex permission structures (i.e. who can access what record) which are needed very large organizations. CockroachDB replicates information in many places, to ensure that information is accessible. Google BigQuery supports a SQL-like API for records stored on Google cloud. In this lecture, we will also talk about software systems that store information like databases, but might not support a database-like API. For instance, there is a system called Hadoop which just stores information in files rather than tables, based on a system called MapReduce from Google. Things like MongoDB use a key-value store, rather than a table-like API. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, when people say “database” they mean something that supports a SQL-like API and guarantees four properties anytime you interact with the API https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID. There are many, many articles online explaining the ACID properties. \n",
    "\n",
    "Question: VoltDB stores records in memory but Postgres stores records on disk. Why do you think someone designed an in-memory database? What might be the advantage of this sort of software? What kinds of applications might be suited to VoltDB? (Hint: accessing disk is slow)\n",
    "\n",
    "The point of all that is not to overwhelm you! Instead, imagine that you are walking into the tool aisle at Home Depot. There are hundreds and hundreds of different tools on the shelves. When you install SQLite, you are essentially picking one particular kind of wrench. That's just a good thing to keep in mind. "
