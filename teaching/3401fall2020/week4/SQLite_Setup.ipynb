    "Beyond reliable favorites like Postgres and MySQL, there are lots and lots of other kinds of databases, which fill different software niches and use cases. For instance, standard databases store records on disk, but **VoltDB** stores records in memory. Some databases like **Oracle** are designed to support complex permission structures (i.e. who can access what record) which are sometimes needed at large organizations. **CockroachDB** replicates information in many machines across the cloud, to ensure that information is always accessible. Google **BigQuery** supports a SQL-like API for records stored on Google cloud.\n",

Recently, there has also been interest in [key-value stores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key%E2%80%93value_database) which offer an alternative API that stores information in a systematic manner without SQL. One common key-value store is **MongoDB**.\n",
