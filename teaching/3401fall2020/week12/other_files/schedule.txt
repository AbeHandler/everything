Mod6 in-class

Music theme
1. json parsing, serialization, format, etc.
2. calls to pushshift API to read music titles, reading in json from requests
3. xml parsing, serialization, format, etc.

4. Using the spotify API, getting comfortable w/ Python wrappers for APIs. To use spotipy they will have to register an app and learn about/set environment variables, which will take much of a class I think
5. Using bs4 to scrape titles from music blog. First minimal example with simple_html.html
6. Putting it all together: which musicians from genre X (via spotify API) show up on a subreddit devoted to genre X by time. Motivate mod7 by pointing out limits of simple string matching (e.g. Rihanna vs. Riri)
