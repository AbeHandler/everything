i could barely leave the house and i was feeling a lot of isolation and i hated the lack of control i had over my own life because everyone else i knew was moving on with theirs
i don t want to feel frustrated about this anymore
i do have to say that at first listen yunhos raps gave me that wtf feeling but after listening a couple times im determined to learn them
i feel more stressed than ever
im sure that oft feel ignored after a summer of planting weeding and harvesting have occupied our hearts hands and minds
i cant do either of these things so i end up trying my hardest to suppress these feelings which makes me irritable and is very tiring
i feel like a bitchy selfish idiot
i know i have certain aspects of my personality attitude that could be improved i have been under the impression that everythings been fine feel absolutely assaulted by the statement that my co workers have been complaining about me behind my back
i feel lonely few days before my birthday
i was feeling resentful enough to want to write about it here which means i need to work on look getting my hackles raised when others judge me
i feel this command is useful to check the free space in log file for all databases in over go
i stop feeling so mad i ll stop behaving like this
i forget that im supposed to be sad about being single or stressed about work and just smile and feel peaceful
i might i could not stress to her how important it is to me not to expose my friends to a situation where they may have cause to feel unwelcome or uncomfortable
i moved away he said something that made me feel violent but its something i still cant make out
i feel flirty playful sexy reckless
i feel im like a bird flying in the air in a very carefree manner
i am feeling like it might look just a little suspicious if i go home and dont meet with him
i feel awkward saying such things
i am feeling so stunned and sad about the earthquake in christchurch new zealand yesterday
i am not even sure how to formulate my thoughts since i just put it down and am feeling slightly overwhelmed
i normally would call meaningless and stupid but i guess im feeling a little bit adventurous
i feel that the director editor missed a teachable moment when tiphany makes her comments about it being nice to feel like everyone else
i think i was addicted to feeling miserable and inadequate especially through the times in college when my teachers drove me to my own breaking point
i found myself feeling jealous though
