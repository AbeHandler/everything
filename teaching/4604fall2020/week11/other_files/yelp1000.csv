"1","After an unpleasant experience at Lotus Grocery on 17 February 2014, I want to caution customers to be careful when paying with cash at the store.  \n\nMy order was $3.08.  I gave the glum and cold middle aged female cashier $10.10.  She put the $10 bill in the till and gave me $2.02 change, which would have been correct had I given her a $5 bill.  I told her that I gave her a ten dollar bill, and she repeatedly insisted that I did not.\n\nI went to the mean middle aged man who appears to be manager or owner and told him of the problem.  He was not interested in hearing it and it eventually fell into the lap of a short, middle aged woman who also appears to be manager, and is one of the nicer people on the staff.\n\nI got nowhere until I asked that a count of the register receipts.  The woman who  appears to be in management suggested that I leave my phone number and that I would be called after the store closes and a count is completed. That was not acceptable to me. I asked that a count be conducted while I waited and she agreed.  As she counted and recounted, I waited patiently.  She ultimately concluded that I was right and gave me my $5.00.  She apologized multiple times; the clerk who would have cheated me out of $5 did not.\n\nI will be careful when shopping at this store.  I will try to pay with one dollar bills in the future and will announce how much money I am handing to the cashier. There is a bitter taste in my mouth about Lotus Grocery.  Of all places for this to happen, it would have to be one where there is a language barrier and where most of the employees are dismissive of the customer.  This is not Giant Eagle!"
"1","I recently moved to this area and decided to stop at this Fry's on the way home from work...big mistake.  I guess I've been spoiled by the Fry's Marketplace I used to frequent near PV. This store really is not that big and it kinda gave me the creeps. I left with only a quarter of what I needed to buy because they didn't not carry most of the items I typically buy.  I had to wait in line forever as there were only 2 registers open. The cashier was nice but the bagger was too busy talking and not paying attention that he was literally putting one item in each of my bags.\n\nI will not return to this Fry's, lesson learned!"
"1","Decent inexpensive Mexican restaurant. Not particularly special. The food was okay and arrived quickly. \nThis place will feed you if you are hungry and don't have a lot of money in your pocket."
"2","Taking a girl here will solidify the win. Trust me. And  yea, they have drinks."
"2","Awesome I have to say. My husband and I saw this in March 2013. Loved the baby carriage in the beginning and once the baby came out and started the comedy acts they were messing with a guy in my area as being his Papa!! hilarious.. The d\u00e9cor was beautiful. The costumes were amazing as well as the story line. I loved the guy in the aerial square. So amazing."
"1","I visited the Old Town Tortilla factory about five years ago with fond memories so when back in Scottsdale tonight I decided to give it another go.\n\nI should have read the Yelp reviews before going, my experience was nothing special. My waiter was friendly enough but the food was just OK. I ordered the Grilled Mahi Mahi Fish Tacos. Upon my waiters advice I order the \""sauce\"" on the side because I was concerned about them being too spicy. What I received was three \""chunks of fish\"" on three mini tortillas with four small condiment bowls containing the black beans, jalape\u00f1o sauce, guacamole and a white cucumber sauce? It just looked kinda strange and the fish wasn't all that fresh. I didn't complain because my waiter only asked if I wanted dessert. \n\nMaybe it's me but it just wasn't what I expected. I think there are a lot of other good choices in Scottsdale."
"2","Called in a delivery order. Lady was super friendly. Got pizza, garlic knots and Italian salad with house dressing. Everything was delicious. Would order from them again for sure."
"1","Of the Michaels in Charlotte this one is probably the one I like the least.  The store always looks terrible, but that is partially due to it being an older store.  The other reason the store looks so terrible is because its a mess (empty and disorganized shelves)!  I'm not sure if this store is physically smaller than the other Michaels in the area, but it definitely lacks selection.  Lastly, our cashier wasn't friendly and seemed like she was being in convinced by having to ring up customers.  For these reasons I generally go to Hobby Lobby or wait until I'm on the other side of Charlotte to go to a different Michaels."
"1","I was craving ribs and fortunately, my gf was nearby Memphis \""championship\"" BBQ. Note that we been here before and loved the food. so tonight we ordered whole BBQ chicken and full slab of babyback ribs. Ordered 2 Mac n cheeses, fries n hush puppies. Instead they replaced 1 Mac w BBQ beans normally I wouldn't mind but it had an off put taste. I didn't eat it. Mac was like albertsons bought n hush puppies were burnt outside n not cooked thoroughly. \n\nNow the ribs n chicken. Chicken was dry n bland. Ribs were tough, bland, weird color and no BBQ or smoke flavor at all. I doubt that it ever was smoked. Seem like it was either boiled or baked then heat up on the grill when ordered. I'll even put up a $1 it's probably microwaved. We are very disappointed. Leftovers gone straight to trash! Waste of money."
"1","I've experienced waayyyyyyy better as a pub downtown. I remember when it opened: it was one of the few spots downtown I liked to go, grab a pint of beer and order some nice pub food on your nice terrasse. Now, not so much. \n\nLet me tell you why in four words: worst customer service ever! \n\nMy last two times were awful: we waited too long for our food on lunchtime during a week day last summer; and on another night after a screening at Fantasia, then again a too-long service. And the waiters were rude, you could feel they were rushed to serve too many people at the same time!\n\nI could have excused it if it happened only one time, but two in the same month? Nope. I'm a sucker for good service and cool servers/waiters. And I heard friends of mine had the same type of experience at your pub. \n\nSo I'm sorry, but you won't see me again in your pub for a damn long time, and I will never recommend your place to my friends when they'll be asking for a pub downtown."
"1","The candy here is way overpriced ($12.99 per pound), but I needed a sugar fix. I'd gone a few days without chocolate so I happened to be walking around in The Mirage and wandered to this store. I saw the Britney Spears couture pop advertised in the front and was steering clear of that section. I got a tiny scoop of chocolate covered gummi bears and a few peach flavored gummi penguins. This cost me $3.25 (1/4 lb). Yikes. The selection is the usual gummis that you could buy in a grocery/convenience store for 99 cents a bag. They had a decent variety of chocolate covered items (pretzels, raisins, nuts, coffee beans). Would not go back unless I needed chocolate to survive. \n\nI did notice in the display case and in the back area of the store that they have bra and panty made of candy. Perfect gift for a bachelorette. Those were running $12-$20."
"2","I'm not a brunch type of person because I'd rather save my appetite for lunch or dinner. However some of my friends are brunch type people and the last 2 visits to Las Vegas I went here to eat with them. Sometimes I surprise myself for being able to wake up on time for a meal this early in Las Vegas. Might be tricky to find but it's below lobby level of The Venetian.\n\nThe food here is very good, and the selection of different type of brunch food and pastries is big. Both times that I've been here, we had to order the foie gras spread. So delicious! Corned Beef Hash was what I had and the portions are very big. \n\nOur waitress was friendly and knew the menu very well."
"1","This place is ok. The food is decent besides the overpriced fajitas that had overcooked meat. The main issue is the terrible service. They argue with you on where you sit and had to ask my waitress to stop grabbing with the hostess to do her job. I am currently trying it again and the waitress is exceptionally impatient and seems to not want to be here at all. The only good experience has been the first time we came here and the manager was fantastic and so was the server. How that has seemed to change. The night crew here is terrible."
"1","So one afternoon, stopped by to eat a chicken teriyaki sandwich. Looked pretty good.\n\nI have this weird thing of chopping my subs into one bite sizes, so was doing that as usual.\nafter I have half of my sub, I find a piece of chiken..... pink inside.\n\nThey served me a half raw chicken sub!\n\nI mean, I noticed this cause of my weird hobby of chopping my sandwich but if I didn't, I probably wouldn't of noticed. . .  don't wanna think about that.\n\nI went to show them that and, they remade me a new chicken teriyaki sub (which was nice) but. . .  I totally lost my appitite and was scared of imagening finding another half raw chicken in my sandwich.\n\nThere's other subway's in town so probably go to those, never back to this one."
"2","Friendly Donut is another favorite donut shop of locals.  A family friend has been raving about them for years and we finally took her advice. And yes, the donuts were good. \n\nIts tucked away in the corner of an old strip mall right in-between a shoe repair shop and a chiropractor. Just look for the simple DONUTS signage. You would pass them buy if you looked only at the store fronts. The interior decor was exactly what I would expect from a good donut shop...simple, a few random pictures, a Buddah statue,  bamboo plants, a advertising board for local business, and a few old tables and chairs. Don't ever judge a donut shop by their dirty tables...judge them by how many people are sitting at those tables! In the mornings, Friendly's has their regulars that will walk thru the door and the lady behind the counter already knows what to get them. On any given morning you'll see all the regular old timer HotRod builders  having donuts talking shop. And you get to check out their cool cars out front.\n\nNow on to the goods...The donuts were similar to another donut shop, I won't name drop...but it rhymes with Donalds Robots LOL! We always pick up a dozen or two of misc of donuts and just take a bite from each one...but our favorites are the maple bars. Its light and fluffy with a delicious glaze. The chocolate covered bars are also good. I'm not a big bear claw fan, but I loved it. It was a good combo of donut and the right amount of flavorful apple fillin...it was just right.. My wife loves the cinnamon roll, its pretty big fluffy donut with a nice taste of cinnamon and glaze.  My in-laws love the Bavarian cream and so does all the old timers who frequent the place. We just tried their maple covered buttermilk donuts and WOW...I think we found ourselves another favorite. We here the apple fritters are good but we haven't tried them yet.\n\nPick up your donuts in the AM (they are open 7 days a week from 4am-10pm), its fresh and you won't be disappointed. Plus you'll have a better selection. The donuts are also CHEAP...I recently picked up a dozen mixed and a dozen donut holes for under $10.00...not bad. And another tip: CASH ONLY! not to worry their are many ATM/ Banks on Boulder Hwy.\n\nFriendly's is right up there with the best of Las Vegas donut shops and it would hang with any of the LA donut shops. Shame on the people who say that Las Vegas has crappy donut shops...here's a tip- you won't find a good donut shop on the LV strip. Look with your mouth not with your eyes.\n\nAloha"
"1","My boyfriend and I decided to come here to try our luck at the roulette tables here and this place is the worse casino ever to gamble.  When we walked in we noticed that NOBODY was here gambling but that didn't stop us.  We went to a roulette table where it was a $10 minimum and decided to play.  First off the tables seemed filthy and dirty with stains all over like they don't know how to take care of their tables.  My boyfriend accidentally spilled his beer on the table and the dealer looked at him with a disgusted look and rolled her eyes at him and off top that was the first negative thing I noticed.  He continued to play at the same table and was standing at the corner of the edge of the table where its hard to reach all the numbers on the other side.  Usually when he can't reach all the numbers he gives his chips to the dealer and tells her which numbers he wants his chips placed (which is NEVER EVER a problem at any other casino but here) and after a couple of times she seemed very snobby and gave him attitude about it.  She actually told my boyfriend to move closer to the middle so that she wouldn't have to place any of his chips for him because it was so hard for her to do! I guess it was so difficult for her to do because that means she would have to pay attention to what's going on with the game.  After she told my boyfriend to move with such harsh attitude that's when we decided to leave! Worse customer service ever!!!!!!! Who the hell hires these people?! And they wonder why people don't gamble at their casino.  \n\nNew York, New York please get your sh!t together.  I will never be coming back here for anything.  Worse casino ever."
"2","Wow... Just had two amazing sandwiches!\n\nFull montagu and caribbean jerk chicken are both delicious sandwiches.  The bread is nice and soft.  Best sandwiches I ever had.  \n\nThere was a line during lunch time, but it goes pretty quick.  No trouble finding a table either."
"2","All you need to know is $2 for an ice cream sandwich! \n\nThe staff was friendly, it's easy to get to, and it's clean. There is not a lot of seating but we were lucky and grabbed a bench out front. \n\nI grabbed a double chocolate chip cookie and a chocolate chip cookie with coffee ice cream sandwiched in the middle. The cookies are soft and chewy. It was a perfect afternoon treat :-)"
"2","Mimosas are to die! Fresh squeezed orange juice that they make for every glass. The servers are so knowledgable in the quality of food and even offered to walk us through the gluten free options. Especially Sam! She really seems to love what she does and was on her A game. Will definitely be coming back !"
"1","From the 9 years of living here, never have they ever screwed up my order. Until recently. I order regular tacos - they give me taco supremes. I order no potatoes in my double potato burrito - they give me potatoes. I get the double cantina CHICKEN quesadilla - they give me steak. I think the employees need to be less self centered & focus on their customer service."
"2","I was all excited to go to this place and then read some mixed yelp reviews, and started wondering.  \n\nWent around 5:30pm on a Sunday evening, and had 5 minute wait. But by the time I left around 8pm, there was a massive crowd inside and outside waiting. Moral of the story....go early.  I showed the coupon to the hostess just to make sure it would be good, and also handed it first thing to our waiter (just because of some of the random coupon mishap experiences mentioned on yelp).  No problems at all.\n\nI'm happy to say this was a great experience. Had joined the eclub and took the email coupon....I'm not sure I would spring for the full price dinner.\n\nService is AMAZING.  Very personable, not overwhelming, extremely professional.  I read some complaints that the cheaper cuts of meat tend to come around more often. Just ask your server or the current person offering meat to your table to send something around. We asked if filet mignon was on the menu for the evening, and less than 5 minutes later the filet mignon guy swung by the table. No annoyance from any of the servers at all. \n\nThe \""salad bar\"" is more like salad/antipasto bar.  But I love antipasto so that wasn't a problem for me.  Spicy cauliflower had me hooked, and the other fresh salad greens, veggies, cheeses were great. The potatoes au grautin over at the salad bar were also splendiferous...yeah that's not a word but it is now.  I would actually consider going back for just the salad bar option (though not sure how much that costs).\n\nThe filet mignon was by far the best, but all the other beef was also extremely tasty. The chicken wrapped in bacon was also good (although how can you go wrong wrapping something in bacon).  I didn't get to warn my partner in time about the yelp reviews regarding the lamb....and those reviews were totally right.  Not our cup of tea.  \n\nYes, the meat is decently salty. Yes, because the salad bar has a lot of antipasto things, it is also salty. But honestly, I was pretty happy with the quality of food.  The exceptions were the lamb and the mashed potatoes brought to the table...the mashed potatoes were indeed toooooooo salty. Did I mention the potatoes au grautin?\n\nWith the coupon, one glass of wine, one soda, $92.  I kind of figure that if you get a filet mignon dinner from a nice restaurant, it will run you at least $35, and with the wide array of meats available, and the fact you could eat as much as you want, that seemed fair.  \n\nIf i had another coupon, think I'd go back. Full price...ehhhh...not sure just because of budget. But I think this place is worth a swing through. The food is definitely very decent, and the service makes the experience great."
"2","Taco Bell... I favor the #7 and #8. Sometimes with nachos, sometimes with a burrito. However, a #8 with a burrito is like 1375 calories if you choose soda with your included drink. I think it's worth it sometimes... Other times I shudder the thought."
"2","Just moved here from vermont looking for great pizza and wings. Well we found it. Pizza is hot crisp tasty. Wings hot, spicy , like i like them to be, staf is friendly and know how to take care of their customers.  They sre quick snd keep your drinks full and bus the table. Nice. Keep up the good work."
"1","4 bottles between 5 people...I asked for water and our waitress told me I need to buy it. I need to pay for an $8 water after we dropped so much for 4 bottles at the table? Is Tryst really that money hungry?..I said that's fine, bring us water and I'll pay for it. Water was never brought. In the entire time we were at our table, our waitress came over maybe 4 times. Maybe. We pretty much took care of ourselves while she was busy dancing on stage and in the walkways. Maybe she should apply for a dancer position and tryst should hire legit waitresses....I've been to Vegas several times and this was very poor bottle service."
"1","so torn on this review - have to say, have been to the location on Camelback and the one on McDowell and the chicken soup at both locations is amazing. BUT - seriously - the kids quesadilla is just plain gross. It looked and tasted like bottom barrel over processed Velveeta. I am now afraid to try anything else on the menu - if you can't get a simple dish like tortilla and cheese to taste halfway decent, there might be a problem. But have to reiterate - the chicken orzo soup is simply divine!"
"1","My  partner  was  in  Banner  Del  Webb  Hospital  twice  in  a  six  week  period.  The  emergency  room  was  a  zoo  of  young  thoughtless  nurses  and  doctors. Very  poor  attitudes  and  not  listening  to  the  problem.  Young,  smart-ass,  know  it  all  attitudes.  Hospital  floor  3 D  is  the  pits.  Lousy  housekeeping,  bed  not  changed  in  3  days,  wastebaskets  not  dumped, floor  in  room  and  bathroom  filthy.  Toilet  seat  not  bolted  down  and  easy  for  an  elderly  patient  to  fall  off.  Some  staff  was  very  good  but  several  were  absolutly  terrible.  Whole  attitude  on  floor  3 D  needs improving.  \n\nVery  mediocre  place.  Avoid  Banner  Del  Webb  if  you  can.  Go  elsewhere."
"1","You know how they have all those television commercials saying, \""If you have a job, we'll put you in a car?\""  This is supposed to be regardless of credit history or location of said job.  I took it for what it was worth, and provided a legitimate job offer to them, one with a starting salary of $55,000/yr, in the door.  I know I have a bad credit rating, as I am still recovering from filing a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy just over 2 years ago, so I am expecting a higher interest rate, which I will have no problem paying to re-establish my credit rating.\n\nI was told that my possible trade-in car wasn't worth much as a trade-in, but if I could come up with $1,000 as a down payment, they would be willing to waive the trade-in requirement and pre-approve me to get into a newer car.  I took the salesman at his word and found a third party individual who was in dire need of a car, and he bought my car for over $1,000.  I called up my insurance company to put in notice that I was purchasing a newer car and needed to upgrade my State minimum to full coverage.  My premium was duly increased, but since I was still covered until the middle of July, I didn't have to make any payments until next month, so all is well so far.\n\nI find out my loan was approved by the bank, but there was a small hiccup:  The bank would not release the funds to the dealer until the first day of my new job.  The new job starts on June 6th, 2011, and the dealer's owner decides at the last moment that he doesn't want to approve the deal because, Heaven forbid, the new job is in Washington, DC...700+ miles away from the middle of nowhere.  The dealer is afraid that just because I have a job offer, it doesn't mean I have been hired, and if I take their 2003 Mercury Grand Marquis to Washington, D.C. and am unable to pay for my car, they have no way of getting their car back.\n\nSo I am now left out in the cold, without a car from O'Brien, without a car that was actually running because I had let someone else purchase it from me, expecting to get a newer car, and now I have to take a bus or train to Washington, DC with just a duffle bag full of clothes and $1,000 in my pocket.  Thanks O'Brien, your false advertisements made such a difference in my life.  So where's the fine print saying that the customer's job offer has to be within 150 miles of the dealer?"
"1","Place has really gone downhill... Using cheaper ingredients and still charging same expensive prices... Very disappointed. Food was terrible"
"1","Wir waren zum brunchen da und es hat uns leider nicht \u00fcberzeugt."
"1","The only reason why I'm giving them 2 stars was because I liked my waiter. We have been waiting to visit this restaurant for a month now. My husband, me and my brother in law all went to try it.  We have read all the reviews online and decided that we wanted to try the Sunday special fixed dinner. We came in super excited to try the four course dinner, Australlia month, and even decided to order a $75 bottle of wine. Which by the way, I got this bottle at The Keg for $20 cheaper and it was a 2005 instead of the 2006 they offered. Right off the bat, we had dirty silverware and had to ask for clean ones.  We started of with a soup...taste was good, but eat one of us ended up with a different portion of pork...me being the least amount.  The salad came out and we got 3 halfs of shrimp, when everyone else got 3 hole shrimp.  We got through the entire bottle of wine before our dinner came out, thats how slow eat course came out.  The main corse came out and we all got the kangaroo, once again not one of us got the same amount of food and each one of us had a different doneness of the meat.  Finally dessert came out and I was super excited to try it. The waiter brought us out new silverware for our dessert, and once again we had to ask for some clean ones.  Once we got the dessert, we found that the meringue was too hard to cut with our forks and wasn't worth all the trouble to eat it. I would not recumend this place for people that like good food.  Please spend less money and go to La Stalla in down town Chandler. We are mad at ourselves for not going there tonight.  Make sure when you go to La Stalla, you get a shot of lemon chello at the end of dinner, its homemade, like everything they have there.  The bes part of La Stalla is there prices are cheaper then The Cork, and its worth every penny."
"1","The most horrible and terrible experience.\n\nI went to this place with my family for lunch buffet, the buffet is over priced $14.99 per person and the following are the items in buffet.\n\n1 veggie soup - flavor less and watery.\n2 cheap appetizer \n\n3 Chicken tikka\n4. steamed rice\n5. lamb curry\n6. Fish curry \n7. veggie curry - no salt and veggies were uncooked and raw.\n8 lentils - flavorless, no salt \n9 rice pudding \n\nService is very bad, there was a middle aged waiter who has an attitude problem.\n\nThe decor is good and looked expensive and therefore it seemed they want to feed customers garbage at expensive rate and make up for the decor cost. \n\nFor the kind of money they charge I could have had better meal in one of the casinos.\n\nThe very thought of this place enrages me and my family because we spent nearly $100 for this crap.\n\nWill never ever go to this place, the owners of this place"
"2","Came here to meet some friends, who claimed this was Korean BBQ even though it's titled Tofu Hut.  Well, they were right, and the story behind the name is they expanded their business and menu to now include lots of Korean meats.  \n\nThis place was great. The servers were very attentive, the sides were tasty, and the price for AYCE BBQ was very reasonable.  \nWe had a big table, so we got like 4 different meats to start...I like all of them, but the cow tongue was a tad \""organy\"" to me.  My favorite was the prime rib steak cuts. \n\nMy only true disappointment is although they serve a chopped salad, they do not have lettuce leaves to wrap the food in.  This is the way I have always eaten it, so I was sad they did not have this option.  But due to the other positives, I still give this place a 5...and I would eat here again....I'll just bring my own head of lettuce.  BYOL ;)"
"2","This review is for the Uptown location.\n\nLots of win here. \nStopped in without a reservation to celebrate a friend's birthday.\n\nGreat, knowledgeable service, \nWarm, pleasant atmosphere, \nWorthwhile wine list,\nDelicious charcuterie and cheese offerings ( Humboldt Fog, anyone?)\n\nDefinitely a welcome Uptown addition."
"1","I was there to have their appetizer as those are my favourite appetizers in France.  However, I was really disappointed as the appetizers were so pricey with the portion that they serve... I think I will never come back here again."
"2","I like this place a lot and come here often. They always give a lot of cream cheese (my favorite part) and their bagels are big and fresh.  I typically get the onion or the blueberry bagel with plain cream cheese and it never fails to make my morning.  I've had the lox sandwich once too and it was really good, so I definitely recommend that as well.  Service is great and fast, great variety in bagels and sandwiches."
"1","We stayed here for a couple of days this summer. The beds were the best part of our stay since they were super comfortable. We honestly didn't stay here that much after we discovered the tram to Aria. We spent a lot more time there than we did at the Monte Carlo. It was decent for what we paid. The pool area is nice since there are a lot of options. Food is alright."
"2","I had the good fortune to have my birthday dinner here tonight and it was really one of the best meals I have ever had....really.\n\nI opted for the dover sole that was deboned table side...(gasp). I mean who goes to a steakhouse to have fish,right?  It was cooked to perfection. \n\nDefinitely the place for a special night out...the view is gorgeous."
"2","I have used At Your Curb to detail three of my vehicles now, one of which I was selling. After Jon was done with the truck I was selling, I almost didn't want to get rid of it. He does such an amazing job; words cannot do justice. His attention to detail and customer service are beyond anything I've ever seen and are why I will continue to use At Your Curb. Don't waste your time shopping around, you won't find a better price for the superior service you will receive."
"1","The food lacked seasoning and the wait staff wasn't attentive, while the place wasn't very busy.\n\nI decided to walk across from my hotel and see what the local place could offer. I ordered the ribs, which were on special and came with a vegetable, salad or soup, and a potato or rice. Being on special I expected it to be something that they were good at. \n\nI ordered the soup and the potato was baked and loaded. Te soup was cabbage pastrami and was good, too hot, but overall decent flavor. Te pastrami wasn't apartment, but small chunks were in the soup. \n\nThe meal came and the vegetables were cauliflower, carrots, and broccoli. The were steamed and still had water on them, they were soft and had no seasoning. The potato was burnt on one side, the ladies consisted of a bit of cheese, a sampling of cold bacon, and a few chives. There were lots of ribs, however they were tough and had minimal flavor. The BBQ had a decent flavor, however it was just poured on and masked the dryness and no seasoning. \n\nTo top it off, I didn't get a drink refill after asking once my meal came and it took even longer to pay the bill. \n\nI had high hopes when I saw the decor, not happy with the outcome."

"1","I am hesitant to give this establish a bad review since I went on there on opening night, but I had such a bad experience that I can't muster up the kindness to give them anymore.\n\nI arrived there about 15 minutes before happy hour ended, which I thought was still plenty of time to get my drinks ordered. Since it was their grand opening, all their drinks were 3 for 1 until 7pm. I ordered a $9 martini and was given my drink along with 2 tickets/coupons that I was told could be used for the other 2 martinis and I could even use them at a later date if I didn't use them all tonight.  At first, I thought this was a great idea - it seemed like I was getting my 3 drinks, without having to order them all at once!  As it turns out (after I ordered 2 more $9 martinis) that these coupons can ONLY BE USED DURING HAPPY HOUR.  No one told us anything about that until it was time to pay, there were no signs posted, and it seemed that other customers were confused by this as well.  I spent an additional $20 on martinis (since I thought they were part of my three) that I wouldn't have otherwise. \n\nAside from the costly drink confusion, the food was mediocre at best.  The french fries were undercooked and we were charged $10 for our bland nachos, even though the menu stated $9. They also need more vegetarian options.  We sat around for a good 15 minutes before a server came to take our order. The drinks were weak - I had THREE martinis (don't judge me!) and felt the same way one Fez martini makes me feel.\n\nI still have my HAPPY HOUR ONLY coupons/tickets that I need to use - so, I guess I will go back.  I had high hopes for this restaurant, as is expected from the people that gave us Fez."
"1","This is a review for a breakfast from March 2013. While the food (with the exception of the burnt beignets) was excellent, the service was horrible. Don't know (or care) if my waitress was having a bad day, but she was nasty! She was argumentative, wouldn't refill my coffee (although I was able to ask other servers to do so), and wouldn't clear empty plates from the table. Incredibly disappointing for a Thomas Keller restaurant. Won't be back."
"2","Very good Hibachi Grill with friendly service!\n\nBeen here once on a busy FRIDAY night, and once on a quiet weekday lunch. Try to find a BOGO coupon in the Savings Books. The steak they use  is NY STRIP, and very tasty. Lunch portions are obviously smaller. We opted out of the All-U-Can-Eat Sushi and Hibachi grill lunch for $9.\n\n\nYou won't be disappointed. Serivce was a little slow, but that's the only negative."
"2","they have amazing red velvet cakes here! i loved their food."
"1","I wanted to like it, I really did.  Reasonably priced sushi, convenient location, menu with all the flavors of the rainbow (roll)?  I didn't even mind the former Pizza Hut layout.  What I DID mind was the 50 minute wait for a to-go order to be completed; when I called to place the order, I was told it would take 25 minutes.  We probably showed up after 30, and then proceeded to sit on a bench for another 20 minutes until the order was complete.  By the time we got our three (yes, only three) rolls home, the spider roll was cold and mushy.  The other two were fine (spicy salmon and rainbow), but after the long wait I think I was maybe just glad to be eating anything.  Provided you don't mind waiting for them to catch, debone and descale, and then finally make your dinner, Koishi is a decent option... but there's many other choices around town."
"2","Thanks Su Vino for contributing to a wonderful afternoon with my goddaughter.  She is an unemployed bartender who recently relocated to Phoenix.  She needed some instruction on wines to complete her resume.  We purchased a Groupon for a wine flight and appetizers.  I was leery after reading some of the reviews.  All I can say is they bent over backwards to assist us, explain things, answer questions, and make this a totally enjoyable experience.  Kudos to our server, Jackie, who really made Melanie feel special.  Their recommendations were spot on.  And the glass of bubbly on the house didn't hurt, either."
"2","Great food great service needs more of a selection I think but overall if your in Vegas defiantly try it"
"2","Hands down my favorite sushi place.  I've been going here for years!\n\nDefinitely order the all you can eat and don't forget that it includes ALL food items on the menu (apps, dessert, etc).  The fact that I can order a lychee sherbet, plum sherbet, AND red bean ice cream for dessert makes it so worth it. :)  Also make sure to check out the daily specials that are posted on the walls."
"2","Now that I have been to Vegas so many times that I know this mall like the back of my hand, I can appreciate its layout. I know where everything is and where I am no matter which corridor I ventured down. I love the variety of the stores in here. I look at a lot of the real high end stores and picture them as museums, with awesome artifacts and exhibits in the store front windows. You may catch some newly weds walking throughout the forum shop areas as they make their way to some of the nice restaurants in here, Spago or Joe's for example. I love their sephora, express, the club like atmosphere of their H&M, and the fun that I have at their MAC store. This is the only Gucci store that I look forward to shopping at. Yes, I'd go all the way to the Vegas location to shop at Gucci. The trevi fountain is a fun photo spot. The bat ray is always something I look forward to seeing, outside the NIKE store. There are tons of stores and so many different ways to get into trouble in here. This is one of the most amazing malls in the Vegas area."
"1","Very disappointing. Ordered delivery and Kabob was overcooked, appetizers were bland, pita was cheap, store bought kind."
"2","Awesome show!!! Fantastic show!! Thank you Recycled Percussion!  \n\nThis is my first time going to Las Vegas and I went with my mom and her older friends. I didn't know what to except when I went in since my mom's friends bought us the tickets when we booked our trip to Vegas. Sure I looked up some videos before I came to the show and it looked interesting enough but they did NO JUSTICE at all! \n\nThe whole experience alone was probably one of my best time in Vegas! No actually scratch that, it is one of the best time I've ever had at any show! I love going to different shows and performances and I've been to my fair handful kind of them too, and that is saying something for my friends and family.  They had a great interaction with the crowd and naturally all of them were like-able if not love-able! I won't spoil any surprises for anyone but you won't leave without a smile on your face! \n\nMy mom is coming back to Vegas with my dad in November and is going to take him to this show and I'm incredibly jealous! I might need to book a second trip just to be able to watch the show again! \n\nI'm kinda bummed I didn't get any merch since my group needed to leave right after. But all their profit of merchandise go to their own charity to fight against bullying. I'll just have to go again to purchase some!"
"1","Had a cupcake at the Foodie Fest on 11/02/12.  The cupcake I had had no flavor so I cant even tell you what it was called. When we bought them they were sitting out open on the table so it was kinda stale. And the size was super tiny...about three bites.  If there was any alcohol in them you couldn't tell...because  the cupcake had no taste.  I wouldn't waste my money if I see this food truck again"
"1","We had great experiences here several times, but our last experience was one that we won't be coming back.  We arrived around 9:30, when they close at 10.  Which most places means they seat until 10.  They seemed annoyed that we were there that late, reminding us of when they close right away.  The dish that I usually got and thought was the best I had ever had at a Thai restaurant, was suddenly the worst.  There was hardly any meat and instead of putting brocoli in it, it was littered with little stubs from the stalks.  It was basically a plate of few noodles and tons of little brocoli stems.  When they saw I didn't like it and I told them why, they just brushed it off and didn't do anything to resolve the issue.  Too bad, I really liked the place and had been there at least 10 times, and now never again.  Mostly because of how they didn't resolve my compliant.  There are other Thai restaurants, so long!"
"1","update: after the last visit to Cosmo that I wrote about, first one with new dog Cody, he did in fact get a skin infection on his feet- a nasty one too- despite the major soapy bath he got when we got home. \nWe'll really just not ever go back. It's a shame, but I'll pay for daycare when he needs to burn off some energy- it's a lot safer."
"1","Wally World sure does attract a lot of strange characters, like moths to a light!\n\nFirst off, parking is horrible here ... on any day, at any time I have struggled here.\nSecondly, it's crowded and loud. From people yelling on their phones, calling for their screaming, temper tantrum children and overrunning the aisles with their carts.\nThirdly, it's unorganized. Shelves can be seen unstocked, items all over the floor ...\nFinally, the service here is slow. Yes, the cashier are in no hurry to take their time.\n\nThe only reason I've ever come to Wal-Mart was to buy basic stuff for the apartment upon moving in and to look for scrubs which they didn't carry anything less than a Large or XLarge. Sure the prices here are dirt cheap, but the environment, clientele, service and quality of their items are questionable."
"2","Le Thai is a very welcome addition to Fremont Street.\n\nArrived at Le Thai about 10:00 P.M. on a Saturday night and sat at the bar.  It was fairly busy.\n\nI really like what they did with this space, though I must admit I don't remember what used to be here.  Lord knows I've stumbled by enough times on my way to/from the Cortez.\n\nOrdered the Three Color Curry (level 4) and a Singha.  The waitress used an Iphone to take my order, gotta love technology.  Some Aussie plopped down next to me, ordered Pad Thai from a different dude (w/o an Iphone), and wolfed down his Pad Thai before I even received my entree.  So much for technology.  To be fair, the Aussie consumed his Pad Thai in about 90 seconds.  I guess the Pad Thai must be good!\n\nThe Three Color Curry was very tasty, although I wish it would have had more kick.  Solid food and fair prices.  And they're open late, which is nice after a long night of gambling and drinking downtown.  \n\nRecommend."
"2","Me and husband went in tonight (our first time)  and the young lady at the counter was soooo friendly. He attitude was amazing. We ordered pizza and wings which both were really good. Came out fast. I needed a few extra things such as ranch and hot peppers she was really friendly ( I've been to other places where they get annoyed if you ask for other things) she had no problem getting them for me. I would definitely come back."
"2","Came here for restaurant week a couple weeks ago. I usually enjoy Fox restaurants, but for some reason had never come here before. For a starter I had the mini tuna tacos, which I thought were great. The taco shell was really crunchy which went very well with the texture of the tuna. \nMy entree was the bacon wrapped pork tenderloin. The bacon had a lot of taste, but wasn't overpowering and went well with the pork. It had a bbq sauce that had the right amount of sweet to it. What really made the entree excellent was the side dish. It was sweet corn with roasted peppers and tomatoes. It was great! Best part of the meal by far, and that shouldn't take away from anything else, it was just that good. \nOne reason I love restaurant week is that I get a dessert with my meal, which I usually don't ever order. I ordered peanut butter chocolate torte...so good. It came with a small scoop of peanut butter ice cream. A perfect way to end a good meal."
"2","Great place to get glasses, from purchase to repair I trust Alex Optical.  Located conveniently at Thomas and 44th street in Phoenix.  I\""m surprised to see only one review, When I go there I have meet so many customers that have used Alex Optical for years.  Located in Central Phoenix, 44th Street and Thomas is a great locations to find your everyday needs.  Fry's, Costco, Office Max in one plaza."
"1","Had brunch on 9/2.\nI ordered pasta, I think it was a bit too salty. My husband ordered steak and egg. Not bad for the price. The server was really nice and helpful."
"2","Well almost a year and they are still there. They must be doing something right. \n\nIf you go to Leslies, or Paddock or Walmart for your pool supplies. STOP \n\nI found that the products at Bobbi's are superior to Walmarts and the staff is so much better then Paddock and Leslies. Seriously. \n\nI am on my 3rd bucket of chlorine and my 2nd floater. They always help me when the water gets a little cloudy and I don't know why, with out selling me a ton of stuff I do not need."
"2","Sandwiches are ok here. The baguette can be a little hard sometimes. The Vietnamese iced coffee is enjoyable but beware it is strong! Love all the pastries and treats they have, from beignets to the french horn. \n\nBonus: Open 24 Hours"
"2","This review is for the lunch buffet.  The food was really good.   Although there was a lot of variety, I wish there was a little more (like at the Mirage).   But I give this 4 stars thanks to the unlimited champagne I received throught my meal. \nP.S.  be prepared to wait in a long line."
"1","Atmosphere here is nice, live the Dia de Los Muertos theme they have going. Drinks are good, not much on draft but definitely a place where a majority of Scottsdale can get a taste of a variety of Mexican beer. The food, well the Duck tacos although good the menu should have read \""Tapa's\"" or appetizer's $4 for 1 baby street taco. Not a good deal, not $4 worth either! If I go back ill make sure to eat somewhere else."
"2","Good food, decent priced lunch menu.  Definitely recommend!"
"1","Firstly, I overheard the cashier making very rude comments about a mentally challenged customer who had just left.  Even if these were   this employee's personal feelings I think it's in poor taste to express those kinds of thoughts in a tone that is audible enough for your other dining customers to here.\n\nI had to settle for Red Oak because the seating in both Starbucks and Caribou Coffee was all occupied.\n\nI ordered the banana and Nutella pancakes that were on special for $5.50.  Just the pancakes no sides were included.  I was hoping more then anything fruit was served with the pancakes..since the place appears to promote healthy food.  When dining in Toronto two slices of fruit usually comes standard but the same is not true around these parts.  Just a slice of honey dew would have been a cheerful addition to the pancakes but no such luck for me. The pancakes were cooked perfectly. \n\n I also got a blueberry mango smoothie that was really delicious and tasted very much of real mango and not of mango flavored syrup. \n\nWhat I did not agree with was the silverware system.  I assumed which I shouldn't have that I would be given silverware. However you have to get your own silverware.  I told the cashier when I placed my order this was my first time dining there it would have been nice had she pointed me in the direction of the silverware after learning that information.\n\nThere is a reason why this place was practically empty when the surrounding restaurant were packed.  The food is expensive. I saw on the chalk board menus that salads go for as much as $9.00 dollars there. \n\nI'd go back for another smootie but nothing more then that."
"1","Never met a ruder staff! Their set-up is also horrible. \n\nFirst with the setup. Six long lines waiting to use the kiosks, which is mandatory. At least one was broken in every group of them. I arrived at 4am and finally got through at 5 minutes to 6am. My flight was scheduled for 630am. I would ask their two attendants for assistance on the kiosk because I was flying on military orders and needed one of them to swipe their badge for me to continue. Every time I would be able to grab one, they would both say, sorry I have to help someone who has been waiting longer. (Which, if was the honest truth, I would be ok with.) I started watching who was behind me in line and started to notice that people who arrived way after me and made their way up to a kiosk were being helped first. I informed the attendants and they stated that they only help those who were here before me. Enough on that, because it fire's me up just thinking about it. \n\nWhen I finally was able to check my bags in and receive my boarding passes, I asked if there was anyway to use first class or get through checking faster because I didn't want to miss my flight. Before I could even finish my statement, I was told, \""you should have planned better and arrived earlier\"". You should never talk to a customer in that way, ever! I bit my tongue, but I wanted to inform her that I was here more then 2 hours prior to my flight.\n\nLong story short, I barely made my flight and will never voluntarily choose to fly United!"
"1","They may be very nice, and helpful when you are buying from them, BUT customer service is non-existant if you happen to have a problem with something that you bought from them.  THE CUSTOMER IS NEVER RIGHT in their viewpoint!"
"1","This was my second trip to this newer Indian restaurant in the Day's Inn on Banksville.  The first time was ok, everything was swimming in oil but the flavors were pretty good and I liked the variety on the buffet.  This time was terrible.  The only Indian meal I have had that was worse was the one I had in this same space with the previous owners.  From top to bottom the dishes lacked depth of flavor and were lacking in some way or another.  The naan was buried in garlic powder and was inedible.  The gulab is served cold and was mushy.  The saag had poor consistancy and flavor.  The channa was cooked improperly and didn't taste good.  Everything was buried in cayenne to the extreme and it was inedible.  The pakora was good and I ate some tandoor because I was hungry.  I like some heat.  \n\nI like the heat you build with fresh and dried chiles.  I do not appreciate the sharp and flavorless heat you get when you dump a bunch of cayenne in a dish.  Mintt and Tamarind do the same ridiculous thing to some of their dishes but the difference is that their dishes have great flavors underneath.  Skip this one and go to Namaste down the street."
"1","Okay I like this place but prices have gotten higher... And the man that works here always looks at everyone like they are going to steal or something! It not like I wanna pocket a 2 dollar nail art! Customer service sucks"
"1","I've been going here since 2000 but never have fallen in love with it like everyone else. Maybe I'm weird. Maybe I've got a very sensitive palette. Maybe I'm just not average, but I find Mama Ricotta's well below average and very very very salty.  I'm not someone who shies away from salt- I always have it on my eggs, etc.  But it seems like recently, everything at Mama's is over seasoned.  A lot of the dishes like the Pasta Primavera is very unremarkable so generally I like the chicken carciofi the best, but perhaps because of the capers it is so salty I can never finish it. I went there for a business lunch (basically the only reason I'll go) and had a roasted beet salad. I thought I was in the clear with a salad, but no- it was so salty too! A salad?? And not a nicoise salad?? It was very strange and it was very overdressed. Perhaps next time I'm forced to go, maybe I should try a sandwich? \n\nThe other complaint i have about this place is the service. One time recently the server was really inattentive. The second time, the server was really bitchy (and it was a guy). I've never understood how someone who relies on tips is smug and rude. Anyway that paired with the mediocre food means I'm never going to intentionally go here. I'd opt for Fiamma, Luciano's or Hawthorne's Pizza before here any day."
"2","We found this place after our fave [ kojan bistro ] closed down. My wife is the true aficiando of Korean cuisine and we decided to try Pepero the day we discovered Kojan had shut down. What can I say we both needed fix. Suffice to say we were glad we did. This is a small family run place in back of a small grocery, much like one would find in Korea. Great food at good prices, well worth the drive across town."
"1","1 star is for the service. Our waiter was attentive and very nice.\nThe 2nd star is for how unhesitatingly apologetic and eager to please the manager seemed after my lunch date had made complained.\n\nI heard this place has delicious dessert and milkshakes! But the name of the restaurant isn't \""Dessert & Milkshake Spot\"". If you're gonna be called \""Meatball Spot\"", your business better have THEE BOMBEST meatballs on the planet. Unfortunately, the taste and quality of the food was not presentable. Even the presentation lacked. Our food arrived in boring @$$ white plates and bowls. Whatever, looks aren't everything. But taste is. Not only were the meatballs bland (i had original sauce and regular meatballs), but they came out cold! Okay, not cold, but lukewarm is hardly how you want to serve food. \n\nMy friend ordered a salad. It came with no dressing. heh.\nBreadsticks were boring too. Who doesn't at least have delicious bread? mmmmmm. bread. \n\n\nAnyways, friend complained. Manager was very receptive to the criticism and took a portion of the bill off and offered a drink next time we stopped in. I'll be taking him up on that (except I want a milkshake).\n\nAs of right now, if you want THE BESTEST meatballs in Vegas, hit up Lavo during the day. Manager told us that the owner of Lavo owns this place too, so maybe they can share recipes."
"2","This classic french restaurant is a jewel in the desert.  An unexpected pleasure located in Cave Creek, amongst the eclectic mix of country and rock n' roll bars.  \n\nThe Oysters Rockefeller were delicious, the Chateaubriand with Hollandaise sauce was lean, tender and flavorful, and the Grand Marnier Souffle is always decadent and cooked to perfection.\n\nThe decor is very dated, but this is to me what gives the place so much charm.  It's a little bit of France, in the desert.  There is nothing pretencious about this place.  \n\nLove it!  It was a great place to enjoy my last meal of 2010."
"2","Along with friends Norm R., Robyn N. & Mike C., I got to be the first customer ever at this excellent new buffet today, which opened in the space formerly occupied by Jungle Buffet.  They were featuring 96 food items, not counting sauces & dressings.  I found the Sushi to be delicious, as was the Mongolian BBQ, which included shrimp, lamb, beef & chicken, along with various veggies.\n\nSome of my other favorite foods here today were the Crab Salad, the Egg Foo Young, & the Orange Chicken.  Minus one Star for the place because the \""Review\"" they have posted on their website from Holly S. is fake.  They just opened for the first time here today!     :-O\n\nWeekday Lunch Buffet $7.29"
"1","I used to like Paradise Bakery a lot more than I do now. They've changed their menu a bunch, and while I appreciate a menu that isn't stagnant, I found myself just staring at their chalk boards unable to find something that sounded appealing. \n\nI ended up selecting their avocado Cobb salad and it came with like three chunks of avocado. My full size salad and a medium sized mediocre iced coffee drink ran me almost $15 after tax.\n\nNot impressed."
"2","I'm reviewing just for the patisserie side! :) \n\nI got the french macarons pack with my friend, a 6-pack for $10.00 + tax. It wasn't so bad, relatively cheap. \n\nOMG. the gelato is amazing here. The Dulce De Luche is to DIE FOR. heaven in a cone! :)"
"2","My favorite bar in las vegas! Great crowd, great bartenders and fun events."
"2","Some of the best mexican food I have ever tried. Delicious seasoning, amazing staff and customer service."
"1","By now, you've probably all seen what this place looks like either on the news, Yelp! or Instagram, and it truly is beautiful inside.\nI came with some family members for Happy Hour.\nI was offered a drink, but declined stating I was going to wait a bit for the rest of my party. Well the server took that to mean that I wasn't going to drink at all that night and routinely ignored me when taking everyone else's drink orders once they arrived.\nThe food was decent. Nothing earth-shattering, inventive or innovative. The blended margarita was good, and the wine was tasty, but as my uncle said \""just because the restaurant looked like a church doesn't mean they have to give us communion sized portions!\""\nWill I come back? Yes, several friends want to try it out. Are there better options? Yes! I'm dying to get back to Gallo Blanco. Better tacos! And less expensive!"
"1","I tried their teriyaki lunch there and although they give you a lot of food it don't taste so great"
"1","Not impressed - food was flavorless. The set-up was cramped but cute vintage and unique. Wait staff looked run down but were nice. My corn beef hash was mushy with uncooked veggies.  The basket of muffins was okay but dry. My wife's biscuit and gravy was bland and cold, potatoes had no seasoning. We wasted $30 and the only pleasant was the wheat toast and my son's pancakes. Even the bacon was soggy and it is hard to hate bacon. We will not return."
"1","Delice gets two stars, and it has nothing to do with the food or coffee. Both are fantastic. In fact, I LOVE the coffee. \n\nIt's the service that stumps me, and why other reviews about this place and the service good stump me even more. My colleagues and I work spitting distance from Delice and come here pretty often. One thing we all agree on is that the experience with Delice employees is unpleasant. We'd probably frequent this place more if it were not for the negative attitudes of the employees. Yesterday morning was the kicker! When I went up to place my order, the girl at the cashier rolled her eyes when she saw me walking up and actually tried to walk away from me. I gave her this look like, what are you doing??? (but I was also slightly amused)...and she stuck around. Four of us got coffee yesterday, just coffee, and we all walked out remarking on how rude everyone was from the cashiers to the barista.\n\nPoint being:  I want coffee again this morning, but I don't want to deal with constipated college girls to get it, so I'll walk an extra block down to Starbucks."
"2","I recently had an interior paint job of bedrooms, bathrooms, trim, and touch up done through a competitor.  The price seemed to float higher and higher, even though I thought we had reached an agreement on the work to be done.  Needless to say, it left a bad taste in my mouth and some of the touch up looked terrible.  \n\nI called David and he was incredibly helpful and sympathetic to my situation.  I bought a couple of gallons of paint and he made the most of the situation on a limited budget.  The house now looks fabulous and I will not hesitate to use him again! \n\nThanks David!"
"2","Shalimar hosted a FootGolf open day last weekend and it was my first time there. Like many older courses in Arizona, they have the charm of Caddyshack style club that doesn't take its self too seriously. The staff were very friendly and helpful. It's only a 9 hole course and it means you can get around quick. It was a fun day playing this new and interesting game.\n\nIt's encouraging to see such a well know established golf club open to ideas and trying out new games to support the club and it's patrons. \n\nGood luck to everyone with this new adventure and supporting FootGolf. If you've never tried it, you should, it's cheap and fun to play for everyone, with little or nor experience in either soccer or golf. I'd recommend it."
"2","3.75 STARS*\n\nMy family always seems to stop by this little restaurant every time we drive through Phoenix. This place used to be extremely busy but the last couple times it's been kind of slow :( On a positive note, the servers are more attentive and they seem to be paying attention to small details that were once overlooked. \n\nThe food here is consistently good, not California Chinese restaurant amazing but still pretty delicious. It reminds me of something my parents would make at home. Portion sizes vary from visit to visit, however it still within reason for their cheap prices.   \n\nOverall, I've had numerous good experiences with food and service at this restaurant and will continue to come here."
"1","Not happy with this place. Went in today for a pedi and it was fine till the guy CUT me with the cuticle nippers. I've been dinged here and there before but even after getting everything done and I was drying I was still BLEEDING. Then after I was trying to take care of my wound the lady who did my mother was asking for us to pay. And I'm thinking like \""can u wait I'm trying to take care of a cut here\"" they need to be more gentle and patient is what I can say. I don't think I'll come back."
"2","I read the reviews but decided to come anyway since we had a gift card. I'm not sure what people are talking about.  Maybe they don't know what Chicago pizza is. We forgot to all for thick crust, but pizza was good.  Wings were bomb."
"1","This place was a hit or miss for me.  Been here a few times, keep in mind, I do not live in this side of town.\n\nI went here for the first time, with my best friend when they just opened.  They didn't have certain things on their menu.  OK, I get it.  They're pretty high tech with their iPads.  That was cool.  The food was pretty great that first time.  \n\nI went again a second time when my sister gave birth and was in Summerlin Hospital. The food was pretty great or I was just really hungry.  I took my niece and nephew and they enjoyed the spaghetti.\n\nI went there again and I ordered the adobo and sinigang.  The adobo was very cold and the sinigang was just warm.  They have a worker there that is very RUDE.  It's the guy who look Filipino and when you speak Tagalog to him he would look at you with a condescending look and say I DON'T SPEAK TAGALOG, Well that's okay, because I speak English VERY WELL.  What an a$$hole! \n\nWord of caution, DO NOT GO THERE for their \""KAMAYAN\"" night.  I do this with my family at home, with the whole banana leaves that's spread out.  The way they serve their food in the \""kamayan\"" night makes for a very GROSS smorgasbord of food you do not want to mix.  IT was a MESS! Do yourselves a favor and contact me for advise as to how to do this CORRECTLY!\n\nHomemade food is so much preferable.  I can cook most of the stuff they have, I'm just on the go a lot.  One thing is for sure, I WILL NEVER EAT here again."
"2","I was very pleased to find this spot. Excellent cocktails, beer and wine. The veal osso bucco actually brought me back  2 nights later. One of the best osso bucco dishes I've ever had!"
"2","Hands down the best repair shop in Vegas.  They specialize in Audi/VW but they work on all types of cars foreign and domestic.  Also they are great at performance work on any car. If your looking for that extra boost in your car take it to CARS!! I have been taking my cars here for years and they are very honest and work with everyone."
"1","Wow what a huge disappointment. Service was ok, not mean or anything, just off, like our server had better things to do. The food was ok, I wasn't impressed. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing? I ordered the margarita pizza since that is my favorite kind. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing. We also got the complimentary bread but it was so hard I actually cut the roof of my mouth from the crust! The Margharita (drink) I got tasted so nasty I swear it was well and not the kind the menu said they used. I know I was not in the minority about the taste of the food as some of my dinner companions had something they did not like about their plate. So once again I think I over hyped myself due to all the rave reviews. Needless to say for the price we paid and the experience we got, this place is not on our list of places to return to."
"2","When I was little, I was a very picky eater. I liked what I liked and would throw a fit if I had to eat something on my \""Do not eat\"" list.  But something changed as an adult.  Now, I am much more adventurous when it comes to food. (Except for ketchup. I still can't eat that stuff!)\n\nSo, when it comes to trying new restaurants and foods, I am more than happy to take a risk. And, that is what led me to Breadfruit.  Yeah, Jamaican food isn't like a culinary feat, and although I love Cuban food (a cousin to Jamaican food, you could say), I'd never ventured to the spicier side of Caribbean cuisine. But, WOW, I'm so glad I did!\n\nIt was a lovely Friday afternoon, when a work friend suggested we head over to Breadfruit for a long, leisurely lunch. And, I must say Breadfruit was a great antidote to a stressful work week. After waiting just a little too long for our menus, we were greeted by a friendly waiter who gave us some recommendations on drinks. My friend had the carrot-coconut juice -- he loves his carrot juice, so he was thrilled they had it on the menu and loved every sip of it. I, on the other hand, just had their house iced tea. They had a lot of other beverage options, I just wanted to avoid something too sweet. \n\nThere was a decent selection of menu choices and everything sounded delicious, so it was tough for me to decided which meal would whet my appetite.  My friend had the jerk chicken, which he said was spicy (of course) but fantastic. I had the brown stew chicken, and in my best Rachel Zoe, it was BA-na-NAs!  The chicken was cooked wonderfully and the flavorful sauce was so complex and delicious my taste buds sang a glorious \""Hallelujah!\"" \n\nI can't wait to go back and try more from their menu.  I was totally eying the plantain avocado spring rolls -- LOVE plantains and LOVE avocados, so I know I would LOVE this!  And, I was really wanting to try the curried chicken dumplings, but I was afraid if I had that for lunch I would be in a food coma for the rest of the day.\n\nYou know a place is good, while during your first visit, you are already planning what your next meal will be!  So for that reason alone, I'd say it was another great culinary adventure for me! Yeah!"
"2","Un excellent restaurant de d\u00e9jeuner!! Tout est tr\u00e8s bon!! L'endroit est magnifique en plus il est tr\u00e8s bien situ\u00e9 en face du parc Molson!! Mon omelette pr\u00e9f\u00e9rer est la San Francisco avec Cr\u00e8me sur et extra chorizo... Humm"
"1","I stayed here last month. It's your average motel (since the doors face outside, not a hallway), and the breakfast buffet is okay (scrambled eggs, hash browns, sausage links, bacon, cereal, batter to make waffles,   and toast provided). The walls are REALLY thin, so thin that the guy snoring next door kept us awake all night. \n\nThe room was clean and equipped with a mini fridge (like the kind you'd keep in your dorm room) and microwave, although lacking a safety deposit box. If you want to keep your items safe, you have to bring your items to the front desk, make a list of what you're dropping off, and then sign. I was uncomfortable making a list, so I decided to forgo this process.\n\nFYI if you call the front desk to order you a taxi, they actually order a car service. The car is an unmarked, dark-colored Lincoln sedan. To go to the 16th Street Sports Bar down the street cost us about $10 vs $6 for an actual taxi (which we ended up taking later). We didn't want to drink and drive, so not bad, but just know that the hotels in the area do not order taxis.\n\nMy main complaint is that we didn't have housekeeping service the entire time, hence the two stars. We left for lunch from 10:30AM - 1:30PM, returned, but housekeeping never arrived. We left again at 3PM for the rest of the day, and housekeeping, upon arrival back at the room after midnight, hadn't come. I called the front desk for someone to bring towels, but since there was no one to cover the front desk, we had to go get the towels ourselves. I also wanted an extra pillow, but the front desk person couldn't leave the front desk to get a pillow out of the housekeeping room. I thought this was very strange.\n\nI guess for less than $100/night (Hilton resort down the street much more expensive), it's not too bad. I would probably stay here again for the mere fact that the location is conducing to our activities. But, if I could find another hotel close by with a similar price, I wouldn't mind staying somewhere else."
"1","My wife and I saw this place featured on the local Mesa city channel one day and they were bragging about their fish and chips. So we decided to give it a go. We get there and are seated at a bar table we were not asked if we wanted something else. but I figured Fri. night, the place was kind of busy. I saw a table tent stating happy hour was 3-6 it was close to 6 so I asked the waitress if we still had time for HH; she stated is it 7' O clock? which I said no but your sign here says 6, she said it was wrong; I said that makes thing very confusing. My wife and I ordered bloody marys and they were horrendous. My wife couldn't even finish hers. We ordered our meals. I saw what I was to believe all you can eat fish and chips and my wife ordered soup. She was brought her soup which was a little to thick for what was supposed to be leek and potato soup.  She wasn't offered any bread or roll or crackers with her soup. My fish and chips came and they were good and when I ordered some more, all I got was fish. I was told I would have to pay extra for the chips. So I got a piece of fish in a wire basket and the paper they use bleeds onto the fish turning it red.. I asked her to bring it on another plate and she looked put out. After we paid, I asked the bald gentleman at the hostess station if he was the manager. he said he was. I asked to see a menu and was about to point to the fish and chips special before I could even get out what I was going to say. I was cut off abruptly by him saying it's all you can eat cod not all you can eat cod and chips. I was OK but it's confusing and you should have your waitresses explain that before they take the order so we know if we want more chips they are extra; He was definitely a prick about it. I just know I will not go back if that's they way they treat customers.\n\nI hope someone from the Harp upper management reads this and takes action"
"2","Sunday afternoon late lunch...tried a couple fo the new taco offerings from the newly redesigned menu.  I had the pick 2 taco for $7.99 plate with Achiote Chicken (it had grilled pineapple and a delicious dipping sauce) and the Southwest Chicken which was okay, not a whole lot of flavor.  He had a enchilada platter and was pleased with it.\n\nThe Achiote Chicken will be a repeat choice and the salsa and chips are my fav of the chain restaurants.  Great service, quiet afternoon crowd and a overall enjoyable experience for right at $20 for 2."
"1","Don't believe the hype. \n\nDrive 6.5 hours to Reno and eat at Sushi Pier!!!\n\nI've been eating sushi since 1984. Way before it was cool. It has always been my favorite food and something I crave regularly. So when I moved to Reno, NV I was excited by AYCE sushi places with reasonable prices and an incredible selection of nigri, maki, and appetizers. \n\nI came to Vegas for a job interview, which went pretty well I might add, and rewarded myself in a typical fashion, with AYCE sushi. I figured how different could it be?\n\nI scoured Yelp for a while and came across Sushimon and Yama Sushi, the two most reviewed AYCE spots around. I chose Sushimon based on Yama reviews stating that they pre sliced their fish and one person had seen cockroaches. \n\nI pulled up and the place was pretty full, good sign, so I sat down and ate. The only memorable things were hamachi Kama and tempura sweet shrimp heads, and they were memorable only because they aren't typically available at my sushi spot in Reno.  \n\nAs a sushi fanatic, there is a price point at which I would rather enjoy the taste and art of well prepared sushi, than gorge myself on very mediocre stuff. And at $30, this hits that spot!\n\nBottom line is people from Las Vegas should know what good food is, and this sure ain't it.\n\n2.5 stars for friendly sushi chef, hamachi Kama, sweet shrimp heads, and plum ice cream. They also get points for serving half rolls."
"2","Best coffee in town. You never would think a donut shop would be known for their coffee but Dunkin Donuts has excellent coffee. The donuts are slightly above average. But over all a good quick on the go breakfast."
"1","Hotel needs to be updated. Upon arrival to our room we opened the door and the smell of weed smacked us in the face. The safe had an old pair of old stinky loafers. The water pressure in the shower was terrible and it took forever to rinse out my hair. The room was not very clean. Trying to park close to the tower you were in was a cluster. Rooms were cheap, but like they say \""you get what you pay for\""  definitely will not stay at this hotel again."
"1","I really wanted to like Uncorked as it is close to where I live and work and it is very cute! However, with the exception of the owner Ali, the service is not good. \n\nI have visited Uncorked 2 times in less than a month and had less than acceptable service by the staff. The last time, the waitress was down right rude to my guest and although the waitress comped our wine, it didn't make up for her terrible attitude. \n\nI think if the staff turned over, that this could be a great little local spot, but until then, I'm not heading back."
"2","Good food, good service, good atmosphere. Nice place to come if you're craving Asian fusion or are celebrating something special. I do recommend you come with a fair amount of people so you'll be able to sample a little of everything as it is family style portions. Items that stood out for me on the menu were the sea bass, shitake mushrooms, and udon noodles. Lots of mushroom which I like and you can taste a hint of the sake they used in it. The sea bass was very fresh, tender, a bit fishy though so if you don't like the fish taste, I wouldn't recommend it. And last but not least, the filet mignon was nicely peppered, grilled, and complimented the udon noodles well. All the other stuff we ordered like pad thai, kung pao chicken, or the lobster wonton didn't excite my taste buds. The kung pao chicken had more vegetables then it did chicken. Boo. The pad thai was dry and not enough sauce, also I found it odd to serve a Thai dish at a Chinese fusion restaurant. The lobster wonton were mediocre. Would have been better if they were smaller or maybe fried. They had too much filling and were soggy. The little fortune cookies they give you at the end are kind of fun. They're chocolate cookies with your not so everyday fortunes :) Service was amazingly fast, 3.5 stars for you Tao!"
"1","SLOW food prep (45 minutes from order to serve). Watched other patrons walk out as well, even though 1/3 of tables were empty. Half of items cold/undercooked upon arrival (including sausage. undercooked pork = DANGER). Banana pancakes excellent. Steak, eggs, potatoes, bacon underwhelming. Server slow and indifferent. Owner kind enough to offer free bacon and cut the bill in half. A nice gesture. Not enough to change my opinion that the establishment is not worth the rating."
"2","love ghostbar!\n-great view\n-good drinks\n-good vibes\ni absolutely loved everything about ghostbar. no complains at all."
"1","Sloppy sandwich. Did you read that Tom? Your sandwich I paid 8 dollars for was sloppily made!\n\nI needed to eat while working at MGM. I wanted to eat at Craftsteak, but it was closed. I saw 'whichcraft and after reading reviews I was skeptical. However, it was there, it was open, there was no line.\n\nI opted for the mozzarella panini. I was weary of ordering a pricier sandwich with meat because of the mediocre reviews of most of them. Sandwich ordered to go.\n\nWait time was fast. Took my panini away and... As I ate it I realized the half I was eating only had cheese in it. Wtf, I thought. So I inspected the other half - and there was the rest of the ingredients. Slopped into the panini, spilling out the other side.\n\nCome on. If I'm going to pay over 8 bucks for a panini could it at least be well made? The flavors were decent, but the presentation was terrible. Plus how can I even rectify the ingredients dispersal situation when everything is already grilled together? That's right... I can't.\n\nIf you want a sammie go to Earl of Sandwich. At least if it sucks, you will not have paid as much for it."
"1","Never the type to write these types of reviews, but believe me when I say DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY COMING TO THIS RIDICULOUS PLACE. \n\nAllow myself to explain my reasoning behind why I would never ever go back to this poorly ran establishment. I have been here twice now and I can confidently say never again.\n\nENCOUNTER ONE: First of all, looking for a place to smoke hookah and get drinks with friends -- this was a location that came up that provided both. I was even more excited that when I googled it, a GroupOn came up. As a precaution, I called Luna prior to purchasing it and they said they were accepting the GroupOns and were open until 3-4 in the morning. With that said, I purchased the GroupOn, which stated one hookah, one hummus trio plate, and one pot of Teavanna tea. My friends and I arrived around 11:30pm. Once seated, I presented the GroupOn to our server and she actually physically took my phone (without asking) to a room behind the bar. When she returned, she said, \""We do not honor GroupOns after 10:00pm.\"" I, very nicely, told her we had called ahead of time and no time limit was mentioned -- nor was any time indicated in the fine print of the GroupOn itself. Very unapologetic, she said there was nothing she could do. I then asked if I could speak to the owner, who, I would like to add, was probably one of the most emotionless and careless people I had ever met. After talking in circles for about 10 minutes, he agreed to provide us with free hookah and a plate of fries on the house... and that he would not use our GroupOn, that we could use it next time we come in. I noticed he had pushed the redeem button on the GroupOn app and when I told him this, he just said not to worry about it... to just remind him next time we come in and he would take care of us. How nice of him, right? So, the night went on, the atmosphere was okay. The music was decent at times, at others it was not good at all. We ended up spending about 250$ on drinks and shots, but the service was terrible. We would have to flag someone down any time we needed something and half the time, I had to ask twice to get something. This is definitely not a place that knows how to work their tips... These girls did not care about providing good customer service one bit. The night ended, and while I wouldn't say it was a memorable night, it wasn't a total fail either -- so I told myself I would give it another try next time. I did have a GroupOn I still was able to use for my next visit afterall.\n\nENCOUNTER TWO: Fast forward two weeks later. I had a friend who was in town visiting, looking for something chill but fun to do. Arriving at 8:30pm, clearly before the supposed undisclosed 10:00pm time frame, I presented the GroupOn to our server. I explained the situation about the last time and how the owner said he would let us use this at another time. She requested to take my phone to show the owner and spoke with him briefly across the room, where he was sitting in a corner smoking hookah with two other people. She came back to say that it was the other owner who said that, and they had called him numerous times without any ability to contact him for verification. She apologized and said there was nothing she could do. Despite the situation, no customer service was given. We decided to stay since we were already there. I was already annoyed... but 30 minutes later, I see the same owner, THE SAME OWNER WHO TOLD ME TO MY FACE HE WOULD HONOR IT TWO WEEKS AGO, who was who she spoke with, who promised the use of the Groupon. We made eye contact for more than a second, to where I knew he knew who I was... and all he could do was awkwardly look away and keep walking. All I could do was laugh! It is obvious business for them isn't going well, based of how the place was not busy at all... but you turning customers away is not going to help your business either. The fact this place lacks serious customer service and has owners who know nothing about customer service themselves vouches for why it is that way. \n\nBottom line, I gave this place a chance... TWICE. The servers are terrible, the drinks are overpriced, the venue is small, and above all, the owner himself is a lying piece of scum. Living in Las Vegas for the last 10 years, I've never been to such a poorly managed establishment. Never again, Luna. My last words: FUCK THAT PLACE."
"2","My trip to Montreal may have ended and I am no longer in the area, but fond memories of my brunch at Cachitos keep playing over and over again in my head.  \n\nThey have excellent customer service, welcoming you and offering a sample as soon as you walk through the door, enticing you to order.  I ordered the Combo that comes with 2 cachitos (I chose beef and the Spinach-Ricotta), a lentil soup and a beverage.  Everything was really good.  The lentil soup will literally warm you from the inside out.  I really liked the Spinach-Ricotta cachito, but the beef one was a bit dry.   You definitely need the mayo sauce they give you on the side for dipping.  \n\nThe above fed two of us and we were quite happy-full.   With an extra order of a caffe and a bite-sized dulce de leche cupcake, our bill rang us up to only $13 for all of this deliciousness!  Seating is limited, so you may have to have a backup plan to take out in case all the tables and chairs are filled."
"2","Had them deliver and it was still hot!  Always great service and really yummy!!"
"2","Quick, high-quality sandwiches and other quick offerings.  The portions are generous and everything was high quality.  Service was good, though it is just counter service (then you can eat at the nearby sports bar, keno, or the small restaurant seating space).\n\nTip...there's a discount coupon in the book you get on hotel check-in.\n\nOh, and the desserts were ridiculously large and very tasty."
"2","Free craps lessons here at 11am-12pm. \n\nI won $500 on the $1 slot machine last trip in january and this trip, I won $1,080, also on the SAME machine. I wish I kept the monies :(\n\nGreedy, I went back to where we were staying, Aria, and lost it all back and more.\n\nWill try again next time :)"
"1","Food and drinks were sub-par.  I used to come here quite often, and for some reason the last year it has seemed to slip off.  This visit the wings were overcooked, and the drinks were extremely diluted for what you would expect a double to be.  Myself and my friend both ordered chicken sandwiches, and both were chared and chewey at the same time (neither of us finished).  This used to be my favorite Maricopa restaurant, but im not so sure anymore."
"1","Sorry - group of 11 and we're offered water for $2 a person and no tap water? BS. The wait service at the bar was extremely slow and although its not the wait staff's fault, the policies of the restaurant are totally bogus. You come to Vegas for the experience and high end service and to be told no tap water available is totally uncalled for.\n\nThe food was on the same scale as maybe Applebee's but also priced at that point. I would avidly recommend you avoid this place - it's a novelty at best."
"1","too expensive, crappy service, and crappy food."
"2","We always get this at work for office lunch..  they deliver and our order is always correct! \n\nI love the nutty mixed up salad. Fruit, chicken, nuts and mixed greens. It comes with a balsamic dressimg...  Awesome!"
"2","Lance arrived on time and proceeded to spend 3 1/2 hours cleaning our ridiculously dirty air ducts. We have evap cooling that we use several months a year, so you can only imagine...The debris he sucked out resembled sand. I'm sure our eyes, sinuses & allergies are going to be thanking Honest Air Duct Cleaning for a very long time! Great price, excellent professional job."
"2","Went in today based on Yelp reviews. I hate spending money on mani/pedis - especially because I usually am disappointed with the leg massage or cuticle trim. I figured this place was cheap enough not to care...\n\nHolly welcomed me immediately. They were a little busy but had plenty of people working. She did a WONDERFUL job!! Great leg/foot massage with sea salt. She was just the right amount of talkative and so kind. She also did a great job on my nails - they look wonderful and are so cleaned up. She rubbed my arms all the way up to my shoulders. It was so relaxing and comfortable. I haven't had such a pleasant mani/pedi experience in a very long time.\n\nBest of all, it was only $30 for a manicure and pedicure! Deal of the century. I will definitely be back :)"
"1","This place always finds a way to mess up my order, I suggest going to a different location. Employees are always in bad moods also"
"1","Well.. when I walked inside, I was first reminded of those hole-in-the-wall establishments. Mind you, those can be really good.\n\nService does indeed lack, but that may be due to just having two servers. The guy seemed clueless to me, half the time, and the girl seemed to know what she was doing. Although, it did take us about 3 tries to get just plain WATER. Whatever drink they provide you with for the tin cans remind me of burnt rice.\n\nAnywho, I ordered the ddukbokki w/ ramen ($10) cause my sister mentioned it and my friend had the pork belly squid item ($20). Next time I'd definitely try the tapas though. Those range about $4+ so it can get pricey ordering those simple dishes.\n\nOn another note, our side dishes didn't come out till after the food, and that was after we asked for them. Another table got their dishes about the time they were seated so that was upsetting. If I do actually go back, I'll have to see if the service gets any better."
"1","I bought a voucher on Deal Chicken and called numerous times to schedule. The frst time I had to leave a message no answer they called back and said they would have the girl in the office call to schedule. She called back a couple of days later and couldn't schedule me at that time for the day I needed. I have a very tight schedule and Tuesday is the only day I am home all day. She said would get back to me which she never called. I called back and finally got it scheduled for Tuesday before Thanksgiving they were a no call no show I called the next day and he said they had a hose break. He said he would come out on Friday and give us the vip treatment because of the mix up. I said  that I would have to have my daughter come over since I would be out of town.  Again no call no show. I called today Tuesday and to find out what happened and he said their truck broke down and was in the shop. Still doesn't explain why he didn't call to say they couldn't make it. Thats is just common courtesy and good business practice. I told them I was going to ask for a refund from Deal Chicken he got very angry and accused me of yelling at him and hung up on me. I got on the phone and called Deal Chicken and they refunded the money. As I was on the phone with them  David called and left me a very snotty message saying he spoke with his business partner they would give me a month free and they were trying to work with me as it had only been a week and they had equipment break down and I was trying to ruin their reputation with Deal Chicken they were going to tell Deal Chicken what they offered me and I wasn't working with them. I wasn't looking for something extra I just wanted what I paid for. The thing is all it would have taken was a PHONE CALL to say they were having equipment problems. I shouldn't be the one that had to call them both times to find out they were having problems. He had two opportunities to call and didn't do it either time. We own a business I understand things happen but you don't leave customers hanging a phone call goes a long ways. I wouldn't have ever written this review had David not called and left me that message. That is bad business"
"2","Best Pho in town!  The service is top notch and the environment is great. I eat here every other week. So far I am in love with the spring rolls and crispy tofu."
"1","Poor food and grumpy service. The Hawaiian BBQ place here previously rocked. Save the upset tummy and head over to another option like Kyklos Greek."
"1","So disappointed by this pet/home sitting service. This past Thanksgiving marked the 3rd time we have used Affordable Home Sitting. The first time was great and we had no issues at all. Brianna was very attentive and let us know if anything out of the ordinary happened. \n\nThe 2nd time we used them we had been gone a couple days and had not heard from them so we called and text them several times and did not hear back until the next day. As a couple who does not have any family in the area and friends out of town it was absolutely nerve wrecking not knowing how our pets were doing. \n\nWe decided to give them another try for our most recent trip, but requested that they text us when at the house (supposed to go at 7-7:30 AM & 8:30-9 PM). They said that would be no problem and since we were having another couple watch them Friday-Tuesday afternoon it would be a good idea for them to also text us when at the house because they had a sitting job before where the family had friends watching the pets and then Affordable Home Sitting taking over half way through and the friends had forgotten to go and when AHS got there it was a huge mess so they don't like to share sits because they end up getting the messy end of things.\n\nOn Tuesday evening around 10 PM we still hadn't heard from AHS so my husband called and left a voicemail asking them to call us back. They did not call, but sent us a text message at 10:20 stating Brianna had visited and said the litter box had not been cleaned, there were 8 dry/not dry pee spots in the office & 2 poop spots. Said it smelled in the office & the dogs weren't in the office. Said she wasn't very happy it was a lot of mess for her to clean up. This is why they don't share sits, because they get the messy end of things. Said the other part of the house kind of smells but can't see until tomorrow. We were obviously concerned by this and reached out to our friends who we're watching the pets before. Our friend (who has watched our pets before with no issues) stated he took the dogs on a walk at 8 Tuesday morning and both went to the bathroom and he left at noon and during the stay there was never a mess in the house/office or backyard. He and his wife walked the dogs twice a day.\n\nNow I had a couple issues with this-first it seems a little too convenient that they told is they didn't like to share sits and then suddenly this time our friends don't take care of our pets and home? Second-there are other ways they could have shared what happened without making it seem like our friends had neglected our animals-for starters calling us to share that with us vs texting it would have been great. Third-we have lights in our home-why can't you see if there's a mess in the other area of the house until the next day? Lastly-we asked them to message us when they were at our house which should have been between 8:30 & 9 and I like to think that if it was that much of a mess they would have called or messaged us then, not at 10:20 after we had to reach out to them, regardless of the fact that they were supposed to message us when at the house mess or no mess\n\nNeedless to say we are done with this company. I hate that our relationship with them ended this way, but there were too many things that didn't make us feel like our pets were truly being taken care of."
"1","It doesn't cost any extra to be nice....and everyone is always 'nice' when I go in. They also print a nice sign. However, they have NO CLUE how to give outstanding customer service. Another example of how businesses can thrive despite their inadequacies."
"1","Where do I start!! I got a great deal on groupon\nSo I was really excited. I did read some reviews after I had booked. But I didn't pay much attention I thought I give it a try. I thought how bad can it be! \nIt was the worst experience ever!!!! Let me just say the lobby was nice it looked clean front desk was really nice. So I so happy and couldn't wait to go in room since I booked the suit with jacuzzi in my room. First thing I noticed as I left the lobby there was no Parking it was packed! I Eventually found a spot after 10min I get up to my room and I noticed the floors seemed dirty like no one moped then I start to feel all the dust up my nose. As I walking around the living room and upstairs to the room I notice the rug was dirty ass f*** toe nails ,Bobbie pins ,chips, screw nails lol I kinds of stuff and did I mention bugs!!!! I was so mad I called housekeeping and the lady was so mad when I pointed everything out! She told me she was tired of this lol then I told her there was no hand soap or bar she got even more mad! And said I don't have any. I asked her for two more towels she replied what for? I said well I need extras and she told me no I need to put them in other rooms. By this point I had enough once she left my room I went to target bought bleach and bleach my tub and jacuzzi!!! That's just the room! Then there is Street bombs living in the back of the hotel!!!! And smoking pot and who knows what! I was checking and checking on my car the hole night. And to top the cherry on top there airport plans pass like every 5seconds and that's all u hear all day and night so loud there is no relaxing! I do not recommend this place at all!!!!! This is horrible also btw!!!! I got bed bug bits!!!! On my feet  and legs I'm so serious guys!!!!!!!! I'm never going back even if it was free for life!!!! Never !!!!!!!!!"
"1","There nothing too special about this place.. they do however have a good T-Bone steak special, which I had. It's basically the typical cafe/coffee house sort of deal. The staff was friendly and attentive."
"1","I had a good time here last weekend and would have reviewed much higher, until I looked at my bank statement! The day after visiting Surrender I had 5 pending transactions from the club on my bank statement - I should have only had 2. The same thing happened to one of my friends, but she had 6 charges. We paid for drinks at different bars within the club, so it wasn't just a fluke. After calling our banks they explained we had to wait until the charges actually went through (up to 3 days) to dispute them. Currently I have 2 incorrect charges that went through and another pending. I called to dispute them with the club, and conveniently the only person who can help me with this (according to the woman who answered the phone) works 10-4, so I will have to call during my working hours to try and get this settled. I'm beyond annoyed and will not recommend that anyone visit Surrender."
"1","Of the thousands of yellow cabs hailed in NYC and other locations, this was the single most offensive cab ride I've ever had. There was a line-up at McCarren after I landed and I was directed towards a cab. The man took my bag and I hopped inside. Told him I was going to the HRH. His reaction... \""F U! I waited for 20 min and you go the the f'n HARD ROCK. THE HARD ROCK. Why do you go there? This is bullsh*t.\""\nMe: Are you talking to me?\nDriver: **huge belch** f*ck you...\n\nHe dropped me off and was shocked I didn't tip him. \n\nMe: You should be nicer to people when they come into town.\nDriver: F*ck you\n\nI took the $5 tip I was going to give to him and immediately threw it into a video blackjack machine. It turned into $20 after two hands. #Win \n\nSkip this company if you can. The other reviews don't lie."
"2","There's nothing like a good pizza and some wine... =)\n\nMy boyfriend bought a groupon for this place so we came here for our date this past weekend. I really liked the setting and outdoor patio of the place. A really good date spot or even a place to get together with friends for dinner. The downside was that their air conditioner was down! We are in Arizona so you can imagine how hot it was. It was actually cooler outside than it was inside. Thank god for those water misters! lol. \n\nWe ordered the Toscana pizza and a pitcher of the White Sangria to wash it down. This place actually reminded me of Sauce. They have the thin crust pizza. I really liked it. Ours was more of a Supreme pizza so it had all the toppings that I loved on it. The Sangria was also tasty. Not too sweet like it usually is. \n\nI felt like the customer service was a bit slow. It was a bit busy when we were there so that's understandable. It took them a while to come over to our table just to get our drink orders. When we requested to get some balsamic vinegar with our bread the waitress forgot about it but she did apologize when she finally brought it to us. \n\nDespite the a/c being down and the customer service being a bit slow I would come back. I really liked the food as well as the ambiance of the restaurant. =)"
"2","This venture was definitely worth the $15 admission price.  I'm a dolphin nut, so I rarely pass up the opportunity to see dolphins.  it's kind of nice to see them just swimming around and not doing tricks or anything.  I did wish there was more information about the dolphins to read or listen to or something.  Instead there was, of all things, a snack stand, and a gift shop (of course).\n\nThe biggest pull at the time of our trip is that one of their dolphins has given birth.... and there's a baby dolphin!  I've never seen a baby dolphin so that was awesome... I wish I'd gotten a better photo of it than I did, but it was cute.  \n\nPast the dolphins you enter the original Secret Garden.  They have white lions, which is quite a rare sight, white tigers, regular tigers, some alpacas (wtf why?) and a leopard.  I understand that behind the chain link fences are dangerous animals, but I wish they had some other type of barrier because the chain link fences were nearly impossible to take pictures through, but I tried.\n\nOn the way in to the big cat (and oddly placed alpaca) area, standard Vegas protocol dictates that they have some employees and a \""photographer\"" hustling your party to pose in front of a green screen to take a photo (for sale in the gift shop!).  As a side note, the number of green screen souvenir photo opportunities in Vegas was ASTOUNDING.\n\nAnd as you leave, of course, you have to exit through the gift shop... and the only exit back into the Mirage walks you right past the dolphin gift shop.\n\nOverall, it was worth it for me and my friend.  And the kids that were everywhere were having what looked like fantastic times so I'd recommend it for families but, I wouldn't really go there again.  One trip is enough."
"2","Being a Las Vegas local for 13 years, this is one of my favorite hang outs. Want to meet up with friends? This is the place. Want a great eatery? This is also the place. I love the Yard House, Brio Tuscan Grill, California Pizza Kitchen, and Claim Jumper.\nStill have to try Miller's Alehouse...I've heard good things about it."
"1","So my niece's graduation cake was DELISH!!... I mean pink champagne with custer filling?.... and the cookies?  \n\nSOOOOOOOOOO GOOOD!! \n\nBut... when ordering the cake I was told by staff that it was a 1/2 sheet cake.  When I picked up the order, it was a 1/4 sheet cake.  REALLY??\n\nFor the size of cake I picked up verse what I ordered.... I'm not a happy customer.  \n\nBut for the cake itself?.... SOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOOOD!"
"1","Que paso Homey?! I come for vacation frm Chicago and thought 'mannn the Mexican food is gona be gooood  being so close to the MothaLand!' But noOoO!  Wow- this was my first impression of Mexican food here- and it was HORRIBLE! I had asada tacos and one chicken taco- they had a literal dab of guacamole and they used cheddar cheese!! Who does that?? What happened to queso Ranceherito or queso fresco?! I will give Phoenix one more chance at Mexican food and then I'm RUNNINNNG back to La Villita where Lil Mexico does it legit!"
"2","I have been a patient for the lst 2 years of Heather Thompson, O.D. \nShe is nice, down to earth and very knowledgable. The office staff are super sweet and very helpful. The Optical staff are very helpful when ordering glasses, contact, etc. Would highly recommend this practice. Great customer service."
"1","Disappointed. The decor is beautiful but the food is bland. Disconnected service. Parking is a nightmare! The manager is very sweet and tried to correct everything from mistakes on our order to mistakes on our bill but the food isn't good enough to return."
"2","We came in when the restaurant was empty on a Saturday afternoon. The waitress/bartender was in the middle of eating king but briskly got to her feet and gave us attentive and thorough service. We were in and out just how we wanted with satiated taste buds!"
"2","1 star = for the awesome & flavorful clam chowder; one of the best I've ever tasted\n\n2 stars = for the fried calamari.  Great and generous portion!  Every bite was crisp.  I don't like the sauce though.\n\n3 stars = oysters!  We always get a dozen...they're fresh and yummers!\n\n4 stars = the way they cook in front of you...check it out for yourself!\n\nGo try it now if you are craving oysters.  They usually have crab leg specials too!  South Point is an awesome casino too!  Huge place and lots of video poker!"
"2","Great food, great staff! This little place is so much better than the big chain Mexican restaurant across the street. Chips and salsa are delicious, and the enchiladas I usually order are fantastic! I do wish their drink prices were a bit cheaper, but that's just a minor issue :) \n\nThere are usually families with small children, so be aware of that if you prefer a more adult environment. We usually do, but when we crave Mexican food, it's worth it :)"
"1","Horrible experience. Sushi was good, but lot of filler. Waitress made a huge deal and embarrassed us in front of everyone because we did not finish our last roll. Told us she was going to charge us $18 on top of the $60 plus we were already paying when there was no way we ate $60 worth of sushi. Then she proceeded to talk to us like children reminding us to not order too much the next time not once but twice. Don't worry, there won't be a next time!"
"2","I've been to dueling piano bars before and while I will say they didn't duel they sure did entertain the crowd. I liked the wide range of music they would play and the jokes kept on rolling. They kept the crowd engaged most of whom were pretty tipsy. Drinks were good and service was also good. I had a great time and will be back again."
"2","I really like Switch. The crowd was a nice mix of people which is something I look for in a restaurant. We each started with a side Caesar salad which had an abundance of cheese, it was the best Caesar I've ever had. I ordered the mac & cheese with lobster & crab, it was so cheesy and delicious. I paid extra for the seafood, but they seemed a little skimpy with it. My hubby ordered some spicy burger, don't think he'd get it again.\n\nWe were seated promptly and received our food quickly. We will be back and next time I'll save room for dessert."
"2","Love this place. My hubby and I used to go here every other Sat. The machines are clean and theres *plenty* of them. The staff is super nice. Go there enough and itll be your \""Cheers\"" of laundromats.\n\nHonestly, the only reason we stopped going here is because the machones at our complex were a bit cheaper and we didnt have to load our laundry into the car. Ive sense noticed a decline in our machines, so we may be going back to Eco soon!"
"1","I've been here a few times now and haven't really been able to find an entr\u00e9e that I would order again. Not much of it seems to have a fresh taste. The pizza is probably the best thing on the menu. \n\nThey always seem busy so maybe it's just me."
"1","Warning to anyone who is conscious of what they put in their body.  I went to Showmars and did my best to select a \""healthy\"" option.   I thought, \""The grilled chicken pita and a small greek salad can't be that bad.\""  After eating, however, I felt completely parched and uncomfortable for the rest of the day.  I checked the nutrition facts on Showmars' own website when I got home that night and realized why.  My \""healthy\"" chicken pita had 1918mg of sodium, and my greek salad had almost 2000!!  That is over TWICE the daily amount the CDC recommends for a whole day.  I feel betrayed.  Everyone knows a hamburger is not the healthiest option, but when you order a grilled chicken and a side salad you don't expect that level of unhealthiness.  While I applaud Showmars for having the nutrition on their site, I think there should be some kind of WARNING for anything that has over 1500mg of sodium, especially when the average customer would never suspect.  It's just irresponsible and shows a complete disregard for the health of their customers.\n\nhttp://showmars.com/menu/Showmars-Nutritional-Information.pdf"
"1","I go to this dunkin or the one on warner around 3-5 times a week. Normally my experiences are really good for most part and my company really loves dunkin for our company meetings as the owner used to own a bunch of locations in new mexico some years ago. I purchased several of the pre-paid coffee books around the holidays where you pay $12 and get 10 hot coffees, just using the booklet of vouchers. At both locations they always allow me to get a iced coffee even though the voucher says hot coffee and almost all the reps at the drive thrus have been more than accommodating and some have even gotten to recognize me as a regular. WELL this morning that came to a halt as I went thru this drive thru on my way to work the MANAGER (WHO HIMSELF WAS WORKING THE DRIVE THRU WINDOW) COLDLY informed me that he would no longer honor that, and I replied that they had always done so at multiple locations, He reminded me that he was the manager and he would make sure it would never be honored again. I could not believe the rudeness of this manager, and I am in customer service management. From here on out I will take my business to the location on warner, not that this manager will probably care."
"1","Lo Siento Rio, but you made me kind of sad and I did not even have to pay for you!\n\nFirst, I did not think our room was super clean when we arrrived, Our shower soap holder thing had a gaping jagged hole in the bottom that looked kind of dangerous. The shower curtain bar is not attached to the wall and falls down if you pull the curtain too hard. Ooops... \n\nThe pool is really nice, but why are all the pools not heated? The one next to the ultra expensive cabanas should most definitely be the most toasty of them all since we were paying extra for our luxury style ovens to watch the World Cup game in. (Wrapping the cabanas up in tarps like a 100 degree present does not allow for any air flow. Every time I sat in there for more than 20 minutes I would get light headed). We also were not informed that the money we paid for the cabanas was a credit towards food. Boyfriend and I were eating leftover buffalo wings in the room when his mother calls us and informs us we have a thousand dollars that needs to be spent in only a few hours.\n\nWhat was even more frustrating is we had ordered some drinks in the cabana and the waitress had brought us a bill to room charge it. Wth? If we have a thousand dollars of credit why did you not just deduct it? Jeez lady.\n\nOur phone also did not work in the room, which we discovered when we wanted room service at 330 AM. Glad you have 24 hour room service, but if I cannot call it then what good does that do? I went to look up the front desk phone number so I could call on my cell phone and there is not a phone number listed on the web site. Only an 800 number to make reservations. Fail. \n\nVegas was nice though! This part just could use a ton of improvment."
"2","Amazing food, service and atmosphere! We will make it a tradition to go back every time we are in Vegas."
"2","Ask for Donald Walker in the Internet Sales department. He is great! Sadly the girl I bought from is no longer with Big Two. So for sure go with Donald Walker. He will take good care of you!"
"1","This is the second time I've stayed at this hotel and the only reason I came back was because my friend was staying here. \n\nI'm very disappointed with my current stay not only because of the resort fees, but the room we had was horrible. After unpacking I decided to take a shower and when I started the water brown water came out of the faucet. There were other little things that I disliked, but I would end up writing an essay. \n\nI would only stay here again if I really had to. Let's say that it's bad enough that I would pay to stay somewhere else even if I could stay here for free."
"2","absolutely one of the biggest, most beautiful clubs i've ever been to! yes, the line SUCKS big time, and unless you have table service, you're looking at standing in line for a good 2-3 hours. we came here memorial weekend, so yes, we already expected that it would be super crowded with long lines.  what we did not expect was a $100 general admission for the guys.  but for girls, it was just $20.  but all my guy friends who paid the gen admission said it was totally worth it.\n\nthe inside of the club looks just like Tryst, but then when you walk outside, its a HUGE pool area with TONS and TONS of places where you can sit and chill. there are these round couches alongside the pool that are used for bottle service, but of course when its not being used, its free for all.  i loved the couch/lounge chairs that were along the INSIDE of the pool! so you can actually take your shoes off and dip your feet in there. this is especially nice for the ladies cuz you know how painful it is to wear heels all night.  \n\nthere are bars everywhere, even small portable bars so you dont have to wait forever long for the bartenders to take your order.  i was super impressed by one of their guy bartenders there whom i was watching take orders from 3-4 different people and made like over 10 drinks at one time. it was nuts just watching him.\n\ndrinks are of course are las vegas expensive. the music was just average. they would play good hip hop for a good 30 minutes and switch to some house/80's mix. but overall, the place was totally off the hook!"
"2","After hearing great things about sin city sushi we had to give it a try. I'm quickly becoming a sushi fanatic so i had to give this place a try. First impression, super small place and of course we got there on a Friday night @ 730 and was told it would be about a 15-20 min wait but it ended up being 40 mins and the bar top is not first come first serve. I have to say I've never waited that long for sushi but i was eager to try it and see if it lived up to its name. They do offer a handful of special rolls for the day that are on the ayce list. The Ugly roll was a special roll and i hope it stays cuz its to die for! I think it's the best roll I've tasted anywhere. We also had the vampire roll that is a must order too. The mussels are a contender to Yama sushi mussels, juicy and flavorful. My standard orders are a cucumber salad which wasn't impressive unfortunately, it was small and not too flavorful. The edamame was good, hot n salty. My fiance ordered the beef curry but wasn't impressed. I had ordered two rolls myself\nthat came to the table 20 mins after my finances order (ugly roll, vampire roll and beef curry) even tho we placed the order all at the same time. So that was kinda upsetting being that I helped myself to his rolls and was full by the time mine came out. I ordered the girlfriend roll which was also a special, good but not as good as the ugly roll. They only offer half rolls on your last order which stinks b/c I like variety and half orders allow that w/o ordering too much. Overall a must try for all sushi lovers!"
"1","I don't get the obsession with this place. The tortillas are fresh but other than that everything is literally dripping in grease but not much flavor. Service is also slow considering it is set up as fast food. Plus any place that closes on Sunday gets an automatic loss of a star from me."
"1","Most unpleasant restaurant experience. Well, the food anyway. Top item on the menu is Philly cheesesteak. When it was delivered, it was chicken. Apparently they didn't even inform the waitress that the menu item will no longer be served. Instead of asking if we wanted to order something else, the kitchen brought us a different dish. On top of it all, it did not taste good. The chicken had no flavor, the onions were microscopic and the peppers were also non-existent, like the cheesesteak itself. It happened to the table next to us as well. Poor waitress had no idea because she didn't deliver the food. Not worth my money."
"1","I have eaten at many Chinese restaurants, and this one was not impressive. They were cold but business friendly.  I asked about an ingredient and they would not add it for an extra cost.  Crab Rangoon is called a \""cheese puff\"" and were ok.  Most of the food lacked seasoning and I felt they were skimpy on ingredients.  Finally, when ever I have ordered a meal with fried rice, it at least had vegetables. So I was disappointed to open my meal and find plain fried rice.  I didn't really feel that there was much heart in the cooking. I will not be revisiting this place. Too bad because its nice inside and clean."
"2","This is the only place in Vegas where you can get Hawaiian Cake Noodle and Malasadas!  I love getting the Seafood Cake Noodle or the Beef Cake noodle.  If you don't know what malasadas are, they are hawaiian donuts, very similar in flavor to the New Orleans beignets; just a little heavier.  A nice fried ball of dough, light and fluffy on the inside with a wonderful crisp outside dusted with powder sugar.  \n\nNoodle palace has excellent lunch specials that start at $4.50 whether you want a hot bowl of wonton noodles, dumplings in soup, some fried rice, or chow fun.  You can't go wrong with chow fun for $4.50, especially when it comes out good and tasty.  \n\nIf you like roasted pork (the stuff with the nice crispy skin), this is the place to order some.  Forget the specialty chinese BBQ places like Sam Woo or BBQ King, at this place, the chef always gives you the best part of the pig.  A nice hunk of pork skin, minimal fat, no bone or bone chips like those other cheap chinese places, and some tasty meat.  Eat it with the hoisin sauce, and you will order it every time.  \n\nOther dishes to try is the Salt and Pepper squid (chinese calamari), Salt and Pepper pork chop, Clams with black bean sauce, any vegetable with XO (don't really know what it means) sauce, or if you are craving noodles on a hot or cold day, the wonton egg noodles are delicious.  \nPortions are a generous size, and the wait staff is always friendly, with quick service.  They are smart enough to take your order in english and help you decide what you want.\n\nOverall, this is a nice cheap alternative to eating on the strip with good chinese food, good service, and always leaving with a doggy bag."
"1","Not happy today with the service or the food.  So different from last year to now, expensive for lunch.  The service was mediocre and the food was okay.   Ordered but had to ask for entree and dessert.  In Italian:  Non contento oggi con il servizio o il cibo. Cos\u00ec diverso dallo scorso anno ad oggi, costoso per il pranzo. Il servizio era mediocre e il cibo era okay. Ordinato ma ha dovuto chiedere per antipasto e dessert."
"1","The atmosphere is interesting, but the noise created by all the whirliegigs is as loud as a bar on Friday night.  The service was terrible, even for a sandwich place.  I was one of four tables, two tables per server.  She walked away as she spoke, she didn't refill water, and was pretty clueless when it came to the menu.  The food was meh at best.  I tried the Lox Salad.  Some lox, nicely flavored, accompanied by a handful of pathetic looking lettuce and a few spoon fulls of rice on an enormous plate for $10.  Presentation was clearly not a consideration.  I want to support local businesses but if given the choice between Ella's and a chain bagel shop, the chain would win hands down in overall experience, food quality, atmosphere, and service."
"1","Don't let the other reviews and their website fool you.  Bragg's is an hour away from where I live and I will never ever return.  The food was mediocre at best.  Heavily oiled and lacking in creativity and flavor.  I ordered the Frank Lloyd Bite and was served an unappetizing plate of hash browns that were swimming in oil, eggplant bacon that was also drenched in oil and inedible, a doughy undercooked biscuit, and pancakes that automatically came topped with a mystery fake butter that when I asked our server about it he replied \""I dunno, not butter\"" and then with some resistance he returned to inform me that it was an oil based butter like spread.  No water or coffee refill until we had finished our meal and had to ask for it.  Overall an unpleasant experience with bad food and poor service.  There are much better establishments for vegan fare in the Phoenix area.\n\n*Update...Three hours later and I now have an extremely upset stomach due to the high amount of oily grease in the food.  Stay Away!!!"
"2","Hamburger Heaven sounds a lot less suave than it actually is.  For me, at least, the name strikes up images of post-club buger vans selling fat, gristle and sugary ketchup in a napkin.  Contrary to expectation, however, the food is actually excellent.  All their burgers are freshly made with good quality pork, beef or chicken, and they have a good quality range of fresh salad and sauces to accompany them.  \nI went for a beef burger in a bun with onions, lettuce and ketchup which tasted amazing.  It was all the better fr the quality of the bun which was nice and fluffy, not one of those crumbly things you get in Lidl.  \nTo top this off, the service is friendly and the prices are reasonable, making it a great place to visit for lunch or dinner when you fancy an alternative to the mighty Big Mac."
"1","Went to San Felipe's Cantina on the 4th of July.  Their Chips and Salsa are excellent!! I had the grilled Fish Tacos and they were very dry.  My server  was good as well.  The reason for the one star is that the AC was out and according to our server it had been out for much of the day.  We were not informed of this until after we were sat and ordered a drink and dinner.  As you can imagine we were miserable and just wanted to eat as fast as we could, get out and cool down."
"1","I have eaten at this restaurant three times, and I've had drastically different experiences each time. The first time I ate here, I had the bone marrow (which was actually delicious) and an Indian dish (I have since forgotten the name of it), which has actually been taken off the menu and rightfully so because it tasted like creole and a mockery to Indian cuisine. The second time I came here, I had the pleasure of eating very tasty mussels with a milk stout. My second experience was actually very pleasant, and I do hope to repeat it if I come back. \n\nWhen I came here my third time, I was met with a rude hostess and a bad brunch. As someone who used to be one, I understand that hosting at a restaurant on a weekend can be demanding and difficult. However, the hostess at this restaurant was not busy but also incompetent and rude. When we arrived, she told us that we would have to wait fifteen minutes. Not only did we wait almost an hour, but she was very combative and unapologetic when I asked for a more accurate waiting time. I wasn't expecting an actual apology, but I was met with excuses and an attitude. As said in my bio, I love eggs benedict, but this restaurant has further proven that I cannot find a delicious plate of eggs benedict in Madison; the egg was tough, and the yolk was dry. I find it almost a crime to cut into a benedict and not be met with a delicious, runny yolk. \n\nOverall, I'm impressed by the bone marrow and the mussels, but the brunch left me disappointed. If I come back, I hope I see a friendlier hostess whose attitude doesn't make me want to walk out."
"2","This Subway is close to where I work, and I've always had speedy service with no hassle."
"2","After a disappointing trip to Dillard's, I decided to go to Sears.  The store was clean, it was easy to find what I was looking for, and the customer service rocked.  A+ for Sears, except for when they push their credit card."
"1","Music is too loud (obnoxious) and the internet sucks, slow. I love Starbucks but at night this more like a nightclub, but you know without the people. Currently using my phone to tether just to do the homework I can barely do because it is so friggin loud here. But this is just the humble opinion of one gold card holder."
"1","This station gets points for being located in Downtown Vegas as opposed to the forlorn South Strip Terminal where Megabus drops off. But otherwise, it's your average soul-sucking Greyhound craphole. I was lucky enough to get placed on a newer Express model bus. Our ride to Salt Lake City was unusually punctual for Greyhound, but the last two hours were almost unbearable due to noxious odors from the bus restroom traveling through the air conditioning vents. It was like riding in a septic tank on wheels. I took a very thorough shower upon reaching my destination."
"1","The food is good, but this particular location is so unorganized, slow and dirty it's ridiculous. Unfortunately, they are one of the fast and close lunch options for employees of the Biltmore Mall complex, so they continue to get our business. Avoid lunch hours and don't expect friendly service."
"2","4 stars for Spring roll only!\n\nDon't know when that I start like their Spring rolls, I just order it again again and again again and again again and again! Everytime get the same thing, and must get SPRING ROLL !!! \n\nI don't have too much experiences on other food but I'll try my best to take pictures on the real food if possible :) \n\nThis place is on the corner of 2nd floor inside 'some' plaza (sorry! I'll update plaza's English name tomorrow). It looks like a 'to-go' places but tables are avaible and pictures on the wall that make you easy to order the one you like + they have sandwiches as well, which the sandwiches are totally different than subway or any other American's style.. it's traditional Vietnamese fusion!"
"1","I normally LOVE Black Bear. After all, my yelp photo is of me in my Black Bear suspenders. \n\nI came here on my birthday yesterday & had an AMAZING time with Dawn! She was so sweet & made me laugh the whole time. It was so good that I thought I'd come back a second time... Guess all good things come to an end. Sad story now..... \n\nDawn wasn't there & we got stuck with this \""waitress\"" named Candy. Very dry/cold, checked back at every table around except ours, seemed irritated through out the experience. Keep in mind, I'm young & my boyfriend is young. But we both have worked in the restaurant industry, we know how to tip. We also know not to profile young couples assuming that they don't have the money to tip. The food took awhile to come out, about 20-25 minutes. Not the normal ticket time for Black Bear. Candy never apologized. It might have been busy, but you're a waitress. Ask for help & keep the service up. We had to GET UP & ask another waitress to get some ketchup, our table didn't have any.  She was only nice at the end when she probably sensed our frustration with the lack of service(oh, and all her other tables left). If there was another Black Bear in town, I would never stop by this one again. \n\nThe Manager or Owner was the first person to check back after we got our food... But that was still about 15 minutes after we got it. He was about the only impressive thing about the experience. He stopped by every single table. \n\nSo to end my sad story, you wonder what I tipped her right??? Well to prove her theory right, I wrote a fat zero on the tip line & a cute little note that read \""Don't profile your guests. Young couples tip well too if you serve them right.\"" \n\nHope she learns her lesson. Until then, I'm calling in before I come to make sure she isn't there. Forewarning to you guys, you should do the same! \n\nHave a great day Hungry Bears :)"
"2","Next door and now part of Circus Circus. It is cheap and old-school Vegas. They have upgraded their slot machines, so it has the newer multi-line penny machines. Didn't see any old coin type machines. You can use your Circus Players Club card in Slots A Fun machines.\n\nI'm mostly a fan because of the inexpensive food and drinks here. There are 3 food places ... Snack Nook which is famous for their cheap foot long hot dog (as of 01/23/11 it is $1.99 or $3.99 combo with bag of chips and a drink), Subway, (with their usual menu), and Noble Roman's Pizza (with 7\"" personal pizzas, lasagna, bread sticks, and a 14\"" pizza). The Snack Nook has other food items besides the hot dog.\n\nNice little inexpensive gift shop with the usual souvenirs and miniature bottles of alcohol."
"2","Thought I'd be hanging in the CLOSED Delta Skyclub (Delta -reopen it!)\n\nTwo of us shared the Big Blue Burrito and Carnitas soft tacos - great way to enjoy both entrees!\n\nNot a huge menu, but I'd eat here again!"
"2","Pinot's Palette was such a fun girls night! Our instructors Rebecca and Melissa were fantastic! We had a blast. She danced and kept us entertained the whole class! It was fun to see how all of painted our paintings differently! We brought our own food and wine and they had everything for us! Including plates, glasses and cork screws! Will definitely be coming back!"
"1","overpriced garbage.  the 12 dollar toastada salad (with three tiny bites of steak) was nothing more than a side salad.  they are so cheap that they charge for chips.  they also do not take total rewards comps (there are no signs to tell anyone in the place or on the menu), and all they could say was sorry.  how about putting up a sign that states you do not take harrah's comps!!!\n\nmuch better places to eat than this garbage, overpriced place."
"1","Food is ok, good popusas. Other then that , service is terrible. Being the only table there I figured we would get our order in no time. Nope took 40min! To get 4 popusas out. My order of bacon wrapped shrimp was a disappointment as the bacon was extremely under cooked.. If you see this place just keep driving."
"2","My boyfriend and I made a dinner reservation for 8:30pm because they had nothing earlier than that, and i don't blame them because it is a small place and we tried to make a reservation for the day of. We got there a couple minutes late, but they still had our table waiting. It was just as small as we had imagined it, but it had a very romantic feel. It was crowded, but it wasn't too loud. The price was right as well for the quantity and the quality of the food.\nThe bread was really good on it's own, but the buttery garlic spread was an excellent touch. We decided to not get an appetizers and get two desserts instead. My boyfriend got the \""Roasted organic chicken breast, caramelized fennel & rapini cavatelli, saffron beurre blanc\"" off of the chalkboard menu which was mediocre at best. I thought the mustard sauce was okay and made the dish taste worse. The chicken was dry as well. \nI got the duck which was absolutely amazing. Everything was well cooked and seasoned really well for my dish. I would definitely get that again. We decided to go for two desserts. We got the olive oil ice cream with the brownie which was interesting. I thought that while eating both at the same time, you couldn't taste the ice cream. It was alright. We also got the caramel, pretzel sandwich with the caramelized green apples. This was the best dessert we have ever had and still rank it as the best dessert after going to other places. the caramel wasn't overpowering and the pretzels brought in the saltiness. The apples was a nice touch and added some sweet and sour flavor. \nAll in all, the dinner was really good and still one of the best dinners we've had as a couple. I would highly recommend the duck and the caramel, pretzel sandwich for dessert. We plan on revisiting again!"
"1","Lolita's Cantina  might be the newest hot spot in Town Square but in my opinion, it's not living up to the hype, with serious issues as regards atmosphere, food and customer service.\n\nI went there as part of a group of 20. The restaurant was empty, and we were expecting a bunch of tables pushed together. Instead, we were seated in an area with couches and stand up tables.\n\nSpeaking as someone who's part Mexican, the \""cantina\"" decor leaves something to be desired - since when did a wall of Tequila become enough to call a restaurant a \""cantina\""? Speaking of tequila, Lolita's promotes themselves as being a tequila bar yet they have no drinks menu available. What's that about?\n\nOnto the food. We ordered small bite appetizers during happy hour and boy were they tiny! The guacamole tasted like the avocado paste that comes in a bag from your local grocer's freezer. My dining companions agreed that the food was okay but nothing to rave about.\n\nAnd then that customer service - I ordered a $5 strawberry margarita, only to be told afterwards that it actually cost $8 because it's \""flavored.\"" Luckily, the bartender \""cut us a deal\"" for $5 - an odd deal, seeing as it isn't mentioned anywhere on the menu that there is an up charge for flavored margaritas. There's that lack of drinks menu again, see?\n\nIt's not all bad - as I said before, the holographic dancers are amazing! But the only way you could possibly get me to go back would be for this show alone. It's a shame that such a great venue seems to have been sloppily put together."
"1","I have been here several times in both warm and cool/ cold months. This is a large space that on weekends can feel very cramped. \n\nAtmosphere - 20, 30, 40 somethings, girl vs guy ratio 2 - 4, frat house, noisy, crowded, massive, messy, spills on your favorite shirt, the majority of people arriving in groups. \n\nService - Again, it is like a frat house here on the weekends. So service here consists of pushing your way to the bar and sticking your money out to let them know you are ready to order. Summers here are a bit better. The outside bar, which faces the river, has easier access. \n\nPrices - The prices are a bit on the higher side for it being in the SouthSide. Mixed drinks are around $7 and beers around $5 and up. \n\nFood - The beer is decent here, I usually get the Hefe Weizen. I am not the biggest beer drinker so I usually switch to Cap'n and Cokes. I have never eaten here (other than a pretzel) as it is always too crowded. I think the less crowded and less rowdy afternoons are probably a better time to try out their food. \n\nOverall - While I have never had a blast here, as I feel I am getting too old to go, I think the best time to go to the Hofbrauhaus is in the summer months. This is because you can escape the craziness of the main area (lodge?) and head to the bottom level to really enjoy some time down by the river."
"1","It is rare that I give such a low rating for a restaurant, however service plays a very important role in the dining experience for me. Was joined by two coworkers to have some after-work drinks and sashimi. \n\nWhen we entered at 6:00PM, the place was empty. The workers were all hanging at the front door waiting for someone (anyone) to dine. When we sat down, the waitress asked if we wanted a drink. I asked if they had chambord for a martini, and she said she would ask. Well, she walked over to a guy playing on the cash register and asked him and then walked away to clean tables....she never returned! \n\nAbout 10 minutes passed and the dude at the cash register finally came over and asked if we wanted anything to drink. When I brought up the earlier request for chambord, he said he doubted they had any. \n\nWe waited for nearly 15 minutes without a glass of water, a drink....nothing. That was all I needed to say \""Sayounara\"" and we were out of there. \n\nSad....we were still the only guests in this place....."
"2","First night in vegas, we decided for a off the strip menu, sushi. Turned out this place has AYCE for $25.95. Since rolls are around $10-13 each, we decided AYCE (we were hungry). We sat at the bar, told the guy (Aaron?)  just give us what he recommends but also ordered some that sparked our interests. He was all smiles and kept them coming. Sashimi rolls are the best( he recommended).The waitress kept our counter cleared of any unwanted dishes without skipping a beat. Good price on the beer- $6.50 for large bottle.  Service was excellent and the food was great. I agree some rolls have a lot of sauce. Just tell the chef easy on the sauce..."
"2","Based on where I live, this is my entrance to the recreation trails that run along the Arizona canal and creeks that have been modified to allow for recreation and water runoff.  I like being able to ride my bike away from traffic.  At times the paths have quite a few folks walking, jogging, riding and even the occasional horse or skater.  There is a 15mph speed limit for bikes in the park but it is largely ignored by the road riders.  The furthest I have gone on the ac/dc path is 24th street.  I actually rode on the paths for about 6 months before I discovered the underpasses on the opposite side of the canal I had been riding on."
"1","We used a Deal Chicken and even at the discounted price, it wasn't worth it.  I ordered the pulled pork dinner with potato salad and sauteed veggies, my husband the brisket with fries and cole slaw.  Both meats were tough and not evenly pulled, with sauce poured over them.  The portion of meat was generous but both tasted bland and undercooked.  The sauteed vegetables, primarily green and red peppers were swimming in oil.  The fries and potato salad were the best part of the meal.  The small piece of cornbread was flavorful.  I am seriously concerned about the cleanliness (or lack thereof) of the place.  The cornbread was on a large baking pan, uncovered.  The sweet tea was served from a bucket with a spigot; the container was labeled \""sweet tea\"" in red marker.  Without the Deal Chicken, the prices would have been sinful.   We won't go back."
"2","Last night, in his work-induced coma on his only night off in ages, my husband mumbled something about dinner... \""what are you hungry for?  what have we not eaten in ages?  And then he answered his own question - Indian.   I remembered seeing positive reviews of a place on Eastern and found it on my yelp app, so off we went.  \n\nWe entered with a bit of hesitation as the restaurant was empty with the exception of two diners... after waiting for what seemed forever, he acknowledged us and invited us to be seated.\n\nI recognized him, but couldn't place his face.  Maybe it was because he handed us menus while talking on a cordless phone and giving the other customers their check...multi-tasking.  Not good for an initial restaurant impression...the husband began to eyeroll me...\n\nBut he became more forgiving as the server helped him through the enormous menu -- and we, as usual, overordered... \n\nVegetable Samosas \nChili Pakoras\nTandoori Chicken\nChicken Tikka Masala\nMango Chicken\nShrimp Tikka\nDal\nSaag with Potatoes\nZeera rice\nRaita\nChili Garlic Naan\n\nnot to mention the complimentary pappadums and chutneys and chilis...\n\nstop it!   Yes, enough food for days...\n\nMy concerns that this would be steam table fare were put to rest once things began to arrive on the table.    Favorite dishes:  the vegetable samosas were incredibly flavorful and delicious.  Mango Chicken (even better than the tikka).  The two vegetable dishes, yellow lentils and the spinach were very satisfying, the rice simple and delicious, and the garlic chili naan was spectacular, particularly with the raita.  \n\nAll in all a very good meal.\n\nOh, and the server?  It's Jignesh, the former manager / server of Sai India Curry -- our favorite little chaat house near UNLV that zipped up unceremoniously a while back.  \n\nBeer (domestic only for now) and wine available.  \n\nIt's a simple, lovely space with good food and kind service...and the owner is definitely Yelp savvy - he encouraged us a to write a yelp review as he bid us adieu..."
"1","I used my Groupon with Sacred Hogan Navajo Frybread. I did not have a very good experience.  Both my friend and I got chicken frybread sandwich, and the chicken was very dry and tasteless.  They ran out of picante salsa, and we had to beg our neighbors to give a little to give some taste.  Even with that, the taste did not improve that much.  We asked our server for some side beans to hopefully give some flavor, and he returned about 15 minutes later when we almost finished telling us that they ran out.\n\nI was taking my buddy out for his b-day, and this was the not the b-day experience I was hoping to give."
"2","Let me make this a short one... Wagyu bone in ribeye was the best thing I ever ate in the protein category. It definitely was A+++ off the richter scale as far as really living it up"
"2","Though an exact date isn't known, homo sapiens probably started making cheese soon after domesticating livestock around 10,000 years ago. This gooey, melty, herculean leap of human advancement is perhaps matched only by the invention of writing, beer, soap, penicillin, vaccination, and the Hubble telescope. So this place is not only a fantastic, but frankly, a necessary addition to 7th Street Market.\n\nThe 2 cheeses I've tried so far were absolutely addictive. I got a really sharp cheddar (great with Gala apples) whose name I regrettably can't remember and a mini wheel of goat cheese for my girlfriend's broccoli and goat cheese soup. Because the prices are a little on the steep side, Orrman's earns extra points for being generous with samples and a willingness to cut the package in half and sell just one wheel from a 2-pack. After all, with pungent goat cheese, a little goes a long way.\n\nIn addition to all the mouthwatering, velvety, some subtle, others downright funky cheeses, they have a decent selection of other things one might associate with cheese; the most important of which are the fresh baguettes. As far as I can tell, it's the only place in the market that sells them. And they're good baguettes too. As good as Amelie's, in fact. This alone is reason to stop by if you're in the market already. Because really, what's a market that doesn't sell baguettes?"
"2","I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but I was already there shopping at there outlet stores. \n\nI went for lunch and it was $16 and got a great selection of sushi. I had plenty of favorites and wished I had room to fill more in my stomach. They had so many great rolls!!! but the good thing about sushi buffet is that I can try em all (and I got full after the first round).\n\nI'd definitely eat here again if I go shopping at the outlet mall."
"2","Heard nothing but good things about this place so i had to check it out. Bachi Burger is like an asian influenced build your own burger place. Had the Just Fries, Garlic Salt & Pepper fries, Truffle Parmessan fries, Sweet Potato fries and Kurobuta and Arabiki Sausages. And yes, i did have help eating all of this. Ordered the Kiki's Burger which included asst. asian mushrooms, bacon, gruyere cheese, sweet onion marmalade and a garlic chili aioli sauce. Good stuff!! You must visit this place if you're a burger fan!!"
"2","I love this spa.  The spa is large, spacious and luxurious (in every aspect).  The peaceful environment helps you unwind and relax.  I have had three treatments here and each experience was very relaxing.  The sauna, steam room and (hot, warm and cold) whirlpools are awesome.  The staff is helpful and friendly, not pretentious at all.  The price is steep for their services (minus one star), but it is worth the splurge."
"1","Service is very slow. It's 7:15 in the morning and they have one person on the cash register and one person making drinks for the drive thru and the inside. Need better service."
"1","Horrible!\nWe had an 830 reservation on a Saturday night. We arrived at 820 n were told it would be about 20min. \nAt 845 I asked the hostess how much longer it would be and was told another 15 min. \nI asked her why and she replied that they only had 3 servers and no busboy. \nMy gf and I had been waiting patiently but how can u be so short staffed on a Saturday night during Arizona restaurant week????\nThe couple next to us had been waiting since 8 for their table and were finally seated at 850!\nWe left and headed to Roaring Fork and a GREAT meal and friendly service!!!!"
"1","I wish I could post a review for the food, but sadly I never got a chance to try it. Several months ago, my fiance and I decided to have our rehearsal dinner here. We spoke with the manager and were told to simply call two weeks before the date, as the restaurant would not be busy. When we called at the agreed upon time, we were surprised/shocked to discover through the outgoing voicemail that the restaurant was closed for the summer. As instructed by the voicemail, we left a message but never received a return call. We were never given any indication that the restaurant would close for the summer. Luckily, Pinnacle Peak Patio was available and more than happy to accommodate our rehearsal dinner."
"2","Whenever I am back in AZ, this is the first and sometimes the only place I will eat! Everything is good - love all the apps and margaritas!"
"1","Was referred to this office by my dentist for a consultation for a possible root canal. Eddie was very blunt and rude, insisted they take an x-ray even though they had a digital copy of one my dentist had taken five days before. He recommended a root canal, for which they charge almost $1,300!! They also charged me $110 for the \""exam\"" he performed. Basically this office has way to much overhead and grossly overcharges their patients as a result. You even get treated badly for the privilege. I'm sure the work they do is satisfactory, but with so many offices in town you can find someone nicer who does better work for less money."
"1","After reading everyone's review about this car wash, i decided not to use this car was for my company vehicles.  I lease over 100 cars for my executives in Arizona.  I was looking in groupon for car good deals.  I ran into this car was and was initially interested.  But, after reviewing everyone's reviews, we decided this is not the place to do business with.  Thank you everyone."
"1","Every time I come here at 530 pm there us a 15 minute wait for chicken. Every time. I'm gonna stop coming. For goodness sakes Mr or ms manager put on more chicken. Really you sell chicken!!!"
"2","This place is simply amazing.  If you are looking for awesome, authentic Carolina BBQ in Charlotte, this is the place to go.  I've had the ribs many times, and they are always warm, moist and tender.  Their sides are always excellent as well.  Usually I go with the mac and cheese and onion rings (i would probably stay away from the pot-salad).  \n\nThe BEER.  BEER...yummmyyy.  Mac's has an eclectic mix of local draft beers.  There are plenty to choose from.  Be warned, you are not finding any $2 drafts here...\n\nIn addition to wonderful food and drinks the ambiance at Mac's is always unique and sure to make your head turn.  Their are plenty of TV screens to hold your attention if their happens to be a game on.  \n\nI highly recommend getting out to Mac's Speed Shop on South Blvd. in Charlotte, NC if you are looking for a truly rewarding and satisfying dining experience."
"2","Had a delicious and beautifully decorated mocha and the breakfast sandwich #2 (egg, cheddar, biscuit) with squash. Great, quality ingredients. The WiFi is super fast here. Only downside is it's not super large and it's very open so no private, little nooks to hunker down in."
"1","this I the 3 rd time I have been here and I ONLY come because it is close to my house when I am on this side of town despite the fact that my bf told me after the first time not to go back. it is a bit pricy comp to what I am uses to in Cali , as my family and I had a salon we have been going to weekly for years and I could get a fabulous mani/pedi for less then what I am charged here just for a pedi. the staff is nice and the space is clean. down fall would be that are extreamly slow , which can get annoying when you have a time budget. this will be my last visit for this reason , I went to pay and told the guy to add $2 toy total for a tip , when I went to sign he added $7 .., I asked him why am that was not what I authorized  , he just looked at me. so I repeated my self and finally another guy chimed in and had him give me the difference in cash. Looks like after this and 3 so-so visits it is timefor me to find a new place to get the feet done , at least till my bf is willing to do them , haha!!"
"1","Pls don't even try to compare this buffet w/ any strip casino buffets...their is no way you should compare them. This is a local casino feeding the local masses and an occasional way word tuorist...Given the local masess arn't much on haute cusine. So this is just basic food for a very low price. Best value is breakfast $4.00 w/ boarding pass..Lunch/Dinner is passable. Nice thing is you get all your courses to choose from. For $7.99 you can't beat it...If you wanted salad, burger, drink gonna cost you more at McDee's and no seconds/refills...enjoy.."
"2","This place is awesome! I'm in love with their TRX classes! I wish my schedule allowed me to try more classes! The only problem I have is the cost is a bit high, but it won't keep me away! Highly recommended!!"
"1","Ehhhhh. \n\nMy boyfriend and I met up with a buddy for happy hour last Friday. He got there first and said he already ordered a beer and some wings. When I asked what flavor wings, he had no idea because he wasn't given any options. He asked for wings and she said OK and walked away and he was left to wonder what he's about to get. \nAfter she came over to take our drink order, I was left to ask the guys if she spoke any English because she couldn't seem to understand us nor did she actually say more than one word at a time. \n\nIt was horrible service!!\n\nWhen I checked in on Yelp, I was given a coupon for a free drink. So when I tried presenting it to her when we asked for the checks she had no idea what it said, so I explained it and that was like talking to wall. \n\nThe wings were tasty, but had no sauce. Do you offer sauce??\n\nThe beers were cheap, but it was like pulling teeth to order one. \n\nI can't think of a good reason to stop in again."
"2","Got my nails done by Cindy today and she truelly is a gem ! The customer service and attention to detail convinced me to get a pedi on top of my mani !! Their drink menu is way too considerate for us customers. If the mani doesn't impress you then the pedi will blow you out of your chair !! Hot stone treatment along with your choice of foot scrub, is beyond relaxing. This place is now my go to nail salon !"
"1","A lot of people seem to like this place so I decided to try it out.\n\nThere was nothing special about the drinks and it is over priced. The tea is not strong enough for my taste. I have tried the green tea in a pot and pistachios latte. I don't see what the hype is for the pistachios latte because it taste like syrup to me. I don't enjoy drinking syrup with milk. \n\nThey have desserts also such as waffles, toast and cake. I have only tried the Italian Lemon Cream Cake. I LOVE the lemon cream cake but I would only have the cake once in a while. $7 for a slice of cake? No thanks. I would rather make my own. \n\nThe environment is really nice. I think a lot of people go there to hang out and study. I feel that the seats are uncomfortable but I love the interior design. The place is nice to look. Serenade is also located in a great complex with great parking."
"1","Looks like all of the good reviews have gone to their head at this place!  Jason and Ryan came out last fall and did a wonderful job pruning, etc.  Called them to come back this spring and no response after first call.  After second call, I was told they could only come on a Monday.  I work Mondays, and left a message what days would work for me. NEVER heard back from them!  After 3 calls, nothing.  Very UNRELIABLE and UNACCOMMODATING.."
"1","I was minding my own business when some punk kid sits next to me. My buddy and I warn him to back off, but he starts to get pushy. Next thing I know, some old man whips out a lighsaber and cuts my arm off.\n\nTerrible place. Bad atmosphere, rude bartenders and dangerous customers. Do not go here."
"2","Good food but service is a little slow, granted the restaurant was packed, but there was an over abundance of staff. Every appetizer I tried was delicious! My pork chop Milanese was very good, but I think I expecting more from Wolfgang Puck. I thought he would have taken it to the next level. It really wasn't anything special."
"1","I have been wanting to try Tryst Cafe for a while now and it saddens me to say that I am not impressed.  I spent too much money for mediocre food.  I was especially disappointed to find the limited coffee options for a cafe. The restaurant has enormous potential. They either need to increase their standards or lower the prices."
"1","Very disappointing.\n\nI came here recently with a friend hoping for flavorful Cuban food but we both found the food  to be mediocre as far as Cuban cuisine goes. I feel bad for leaving such a short review, but there just isn't much else to say. I can't complain about the service, wait time or the atmosphere, the food was just rather bland and very disappointing. \n\nI am a vegetarian and my friend a carnivore and we were both disappointed with the our meals. The food didn't taste horrible, it was just lacking in flavor (think Luby's) and we left with no reason to come back in the future. \n\nI have since heard that the Havana Cafe location down on E. Camelback is much better so will look forward to giving that location a try next time I am in the area. Hopefully I will have great things to report."
"2","All you 2- and 3-star reviewers out there are crazy! This one is a diamond in the rough, as far as the casino goes. \nFour Queens is my one and only, all-time favorite place to gamble. I go to Four Queens every time I am in Vegas. EVERY time. Every time I win any money, it happens at Four Queens. I have played blackjack, blackjack \""switch,\"" craps, keno, and even the damn SLOTS and have won money here! Uh... except at the bar. Don't bother with the video poker at the bars. \nGambling is cheap, cocktail waitresses are attentive, and staff has fun with you as well. \n\nThe only real downside is the hotel. I've been in two rooms here and the walls are pretty thin. You can hear everything - talking, flushing, even humping all the way down the hallway. And they still use those yucky multi-colored covers on the beds. \n\nAt King's Bar, you can get a huge beer in a football-shaped cup with a straw, if you're so inclined to do so."
"2","\""This is what Vegas is all about\"" my fiance uttered as we walked into the Lounge area at Mix.\n\nMy review is for the Mix Lounge only.  It was about 8PM on Sunday night.  It was Labor Day weekend so we expected somewhat of a crowd.  Based on past yelp reviews I was eager to make it to Mix Lounge and didn't care what I had to do to get there.  Luckily, there was a huge wait at Burger Bar, so I was able to convince my fiance to stop in at Mix Lounge for a pre dinner drink.\n\nLet me preface - we are NOT the clubbin types AT ALL.  Our preferences range from drinking beers at a local dive bar, to listening to top 40 at a swanky lounge sippin a cocktail or single malt scotch.  But the packed like sardines wall to wall club style where all the guys are dressed the same and the girls are looking for rich guys is NOT for us.  More along the lines of where Frank Sinatra would've smoked a cigar and sang to an intimate crowd.\n\nThe Mandalay Bay was super busy and we did see an overabundance of club shirts walking around.  I could tell there was some hesitation on my bf's face but I would not deterred.  I had read that the place doesn't really get crowded until after 10PM, and they don't charge cover until then either.  But even if you did want to visit Mix after 10PM, there are a ton of Mandalay Bay promoters handing out free cover and line passes throughout the hotel.  So avoiding cover doesn't seem to be a problem.\n\nThe experience to get to the Mix Lounge can be confusing I have to admit, yet exciting at the same time.  Mix Lounge and Restaurant is actually atop The Hotel at Mandalay Bay, and there is a cool red sign that makes it visible to the passerby.  We made the mistake of taking a right and heading towards the elevators to the actual hotel rooms (we weren't the only ones), as opposed to taking a left and heading to the express elevator to Mix.  Riding in the elevator was an experience in itself because it is literally on the 64th floor!\n\nWhen we finally arrived, we walked through the gorgeous restaurant to get to the lounge.  The restaurant decor was soo beautiful - white furniture and flooring with white twinkle lights all around.  Dimly lit and something straight out of a movie.  Although we did not dine, and probably never will, it was an amazing sight.  We walked passed the kitchen and within a few steps - entered a dark room with awesome red chairs and lighting.  To the right - a huge bar.  To the left - the most amazing view of the Las Vegas strip, EVER.  We have stayed at the Signature at MGM Grand and stood on the balcony of our room.  We've stayed at the Palms Place and stood on the balcony of our room. But nothing comes close to the view at the Mix Lounge.  It truly is phenomenal - being located at the end of the strip allows you to see all of Las Vegas in front of you (Bellagio, Paris, the City Center).\n\nIt was basically empty at 8PM on a Sunday which is sad, but a plus for us since we aren't really into the crowds and the loud music.  And we don't like having to wait forever to get a drink.  We were greeted by super nice bartender who promptly brought us our beers (they do have Guinness and Sierra Nevada - and for $8 a beer we found that extremely reasonable, considering we had paid almost twice that at the House of Blues the night before)!  Unfortunately, we had a prior commitment off the strip and knew we had to drive - but if we hadn't - we would've gone for a stronger more potent cocktail.  They seemed to have a wonderful selection of alcohol, ranging from single malt scotches to a wide variety of vodka.\n\nAnd then, we just took it all in.  Sitting at the bar, drinking our beverages, listening to laid back music, a view of the entire strip capturing our attention.  There were tables with booths in front of us - a very romantic setting. I could see ourselves sitting in a booth, just staring out at Vegas all night.  It was a surprisingly comfy feel for being a Vegas Lounge.  There is also a patio that you can walk onto to take a picture.  We took many.  In the very back of the lounge is a cool dance floor.  I am not sure how busy it gets busy later on - or how much the dance floor gets used - but it was a cool area.\n\nAfter we finished our beverages, we reluctantly paid our tab and left. Again, our bartender was super nice and took our picture.  We then took the elevator we were supposed to use originally.  It's a non-stop express elevator that literally takes you through 64 floors in a matter of seconds.  It is located by the dance floor, and this allows you to avoid walking through the restaurant.  The elevator is all glass so on your way up, or down, you can see the strip all lit up and gorgeous as it should be.\n\nAll in all - we had an amazing experience at Mix Lounge. It was just what we were looking for - a breathtaking start to a Las Vegas night."
"1","My only qualm is the insecure doors. Do the ol' chair stack and you'll be fine. This place is literally a stone's throw from major locations on the strip, for 50 bucks a night. TV receives about 4 well-picked channels (NBC, TNT, ESPN, and porn). Bathrooms are bright and spacious, mattresses firm and yet... springy. Friendly staff and remarkably easy-in, easy-out experience, worthy of a 3/5 rating. We'll be coming back!"
"1","Yeeeeah. This place was okay. Unfortunately for them, I loooove Mexican food and this was my first fix in months. So from lack of delicious Mexican food, my standards had risen. Sure, they have free chips and salsa. That's standard, right? I though the service was a little slow once the check was dropped, but will say, for lunch, the price and quickness of the food was decent. It may have had something to do with the fact that there was only 2 other people in the place. I've had better, but don't know where in Pittsburgh. Anyone? Hello? Is this thing on?"
"1","Went into the lounge for a couple of cocktails with a friend.  Upon exiting down a two step flight of stairs, my drink was instantly swiped from my hand by the bartender and my friends' by the hostess to be poured into plastic cups.  Really!?\n\nUpon asking would you have done this to Paris Hilton? the response by the little blonde hostess was \""Oh yes! Absolutely!\""  ... Yeah right!  \n\nOnly place in Vegas that simply cannot part with their glassware.  \n\nAria has an amazing energy & integrity, absolute understated elegance, however, the servers at Union are pretentious and don't belong in this hotel at all!!!"
"2","Maria is AMAZING! Super personable and excited to help. Got me in right away. Took her time and made me feel extremely comfortable. The office is clean and pretty. Blows miracle in progress out of the water, I will definitely be returning!"
"1","I have been to this location many times to get propane in my truck, and every single time, I have left there feeling very frustrated. To get propane, you pull up to the propane tank area and ring a doorbell to let the employees know that you need assistance. There is no way to communicate with the employees without going into the building, and you can not see to the inside from the propane tank area. There is no way of knowing if the bell worked after pressing the button, and no way of knowing if anyone is at the register area to hear it.\n\nI have never waited less than five minutes for someone to respond at this location, and today it took me more than 25 minutes to get out of there. I went inside the building and could not find ANYONE manning the 'store' and no way to signal or summon anyone, but many employees were standing around in back. I called out to the nearest one, who was cleaning a truck, and told him I needed help. He said he would send someone out, so I went back to my truck to wait. Another five minutes passed, and the same employee drove the truck I had just seen him cleaning to the front. I made him aware that I was STILL waiting, and he said he would send someone. Another five minutes and I felt like I was being held hostage. not being able to leave because my tank was empty and I didn't know if I could make it to another station that sold propane. Yet another employee drove a truck to the front, and I let HIM know I had been waiting a very long time, and he said he would send someone out. Oy. \n\nAfter waiting in 104F heat, someone FINALLY came out and filled my tank, and then the \""pay at the pump\"" gadget failed to work, and I was asked to go inside again to pay. Once inside there was some other computer problem and I had to wait another few minutes for that to get sorted out. Twenty-five minutes to get gas in my truck is ridiculous.  I have never rented a truck from this location, so I can't speak for their customer service in that area, but I will NOT be using this location again except in cases of extreme emergency. VERY disappointed with my experiences here. \n\nLuckily I work near the Gilbert location, and their customer service is outstanding. I will have to arrange my schedule to fill up there from now on."
"1","I decided to go here because many of my friends have raved about the freshness of their food. I bought a halibut filet and it was ok, but I did find three bones in it. I hate finding bones in my fish filets! I also got excited when I went to the meat department and saw an array of sausages! I ended up getting some andioulle sausage. This was the worst sausage I have ever had in my life!!! I grilled them and they came dry and completely flavorless! They were awful! I can't express how disappointed I was! I think I'm going to stick with Whole Foods!"
"1","I am unsure as to why this place is supposed to be so great.  When they took over Waterworld they marketed it as if they completely redid everything, remodeling the whole place to make it totally awesome.  Well lets see, they added some slides. Put up some new signs, and put in hi-tech lockers.  That is about all I could see as far as remodel.  \n\nThe boy and I used to frequent WW at least once a summer and once we saw the prices of its replacement decided it was not worth it.  However, this year we received free entry passes, so we figured why not.... Sadly we still fee ripped off.\n\n$7 to park, surely they must of added coverage to the parking lot to justify the price right? I mean it is AZ.. in SUMMER, the only reason to pay to park is if it is covered... no such luck.\n\nThe \""security\"" at the front checking bags and purses....yeah, I get it, they are 16 and getting paid minimum wage to stand in the sun all day... but the dude didn't even look down at the table to pretend like he was looking at my purse or bag.... should of brought a flask, would of made the day more fun!\n\nThe lockers were neat, no annoying key to lose...that was about the only upside of the whole place.  Mind you the girl at the locker rental told us about a million times that we MUST use the PINK lockers because that is what we had paid for... ok, cool..I like pink and the $7 \""small\"" lockers were actually good sized.  She even wrote a big P on my wrist band... you know in case I forgot in the 5 ft walk to the lockers.... Well, funny thing is that after all of that the computerized lockers promptly told me that my band was only good for the ORANGE lockers... which you know made sense considering my wrist band was ORANGE.... sigh... maybe she missed the color day in Kindergarten.\n\nWe got to the wave pool..it was fine, nothing special.  Went to the lazy river.... YUCK!  I don't know when the last time it was cleaned was?!?!  I understand it is summer in AZ, we do get winds and they do blow leaves into the water... but Damn!  You could barely see the water for all the debris, there was a bandaid stuck to one of the walls.  And it looked like the river surface had not been resurfaced in at least 15 years, definitely not when the \""remodel\"" took place when WnW took over!\n\nThe lines for all of the slides were at least 100 people deep and not really moving too fast, so we skipped them...wasn't worth it.\n\nWe knew that food and drink would be way overpriced and mediocre at best, so we ate before we got there... Good thing too, these prices were in fair competition with Disneyland food prices, and everyone knows what a rip off that is!\n\nOverall:\nThe only thing remotely cool about the place was the electronic lockers.  The staff was all on their teenage first job power trips, it was far too crowded to have much fun, it wasn't that clean, and all prices were far overpriced for what you are getting.  \n\nI am not shocked by the shitty reviews the place has, just shocked that they aren't doing something to change...For goodness sake Salt River Tubing has better reviews than this place, and people poo and puke in that river!"
"2","Sinatra's, located in the Wynn resort, has a classic elegant charm displaying great attention to detail along with the \""Frank\"" memorabilia. Upon arrival we sat at the bar where they had High Society playing on a large flat panel above the bar. It was a playful atmosphere and I enjoyed looking out to the patio area that had fireplaces, trees wrapped in white lights as well as heat lamps. Everyone inside & out seemed to be having a fun evening. \n\nShortly after arriving we were promptly seated in a large dining area~ not very intimate as I was hoping but nice nonetheless. Our server was very efficient in taking our order which included the Polpettine (meatballs & polenta fries) appetizer for my husband and the Panzanella con Granchio (lump blue crab, brioche croutons, tomatoes, cucumber with tomato fonduta) for myself. My husband thoroughly enjoyed his meatballs and we were both surprised how much we enjoyed the polenta fries which I've never had before. My appetizer arrived looking much different than I visualized but I truly enjoyed the large pieces of blue crab as well as the tomato fonduta. We leisurely enjoyed our appetizers also partaking of the breadbasket & sipping our drinks. For our main entr\u00e9es my husband had the  Lasagne Bolognese that arrived in a oval tin and initially wasn't sure how to \""dig in\"". However, once started he said it was a very flavorful lasagna and was very pleased with his selection. I had Frank's Spaghetti & Clams which was served in a bowl overflowing with clams. The clams were cooked to perfection - tender and not chewy & the pasta was al dente how I like it. The only thing that needed some \""help\"" was the tomato garlic broth which was a bit too mild and needed a bit more seasoning. \n\nOur server  who seemed a bit overwhelmed with a very large party and several smaller parties did his best to be attentive however, he took my empty cocktail glass never asking if I would like another. So, I didn't get another scrumptious pear martini until we finished our meal. \n\nOnce the table was cleared the server brought a small plate of various chocolates, biscotti and a piece of caramel which was soft & melt-in-your-mouth yummy.  \n\nWe both very much enjoyed our experience and, if we find ourselves back at the Wynn, would certainly partake in another meal at Sinatra's."
"2","i've seriously never recovered from any sickness sooooo fast!!!\n\ni was rushed here by my wife and mother because i seriously felt like i was getting sparta kicked in the chest every 10 seconds while coughing. it turns out that i had bronchitis and pneumonia at the same time... (i know... fml right???)\n\nthe pac christin anzini, was able to diagnose me fast and give me the proper meds to get me better.\n\ni was literally better the next day!!! thank you sooooooo much christin!!!! you're awesome!!"
"2","I took the kids here today; 9, 12 & 16 and they LOVED it!! This isn't a gourmet dining spot so if that's what you are looking, keep looking. I think the old cash registers, the different lines & old school salad bar give it a fun, eclectic feel! The kids enjoyed watching for their number, requesting songs, and signing along to the songs. The also loved the bench seating and the overall atmosphere. We all thought the pizza was pretty good and had no complaints. I would definitely bring them back here!"
"1","This restaurant personifies everything I hate about the Paris Hotel. It is too over the top in its efforts to match the French theme...and in doing so, sacrifices much of its quality.\n\nI visited this establishment when I was on a steak hunt...trying Rib-eye steaks at different restaurants throughout the US. The steak was decent, but in trying to meet the French theme, sauced the thing to death. \n\nPerhaps there are better options on the menu...maybe I just picked the wrong thing during my great steak hunt phase. But in my opinion, there are much better places to eat on the strip that don't involve a theme other than good food!\n\nThis is my first one-star review. I would honestly consider giving it 0-stars if that were an option."
"1","Our group of 20 or so friends & family were in town for our annual Superbowl weekend trip. The hubby & I always do \""date night\"" with a nice dinner & dancing the Saturday we arrive. We'd last dined at the Hard Rock a couple of years ago prior to attending the Santana concert, when this place was known as Rare 120. We had a great experience then & figured we'd return. Unfortunately, along with the name & decor change came a serious decline in service. We arrived 5 minutes early for our 9 p.m. dinner reservation & were told we couldn't be seated due to the fact that we were early. I mentioned to the hostess that we were only 5 minutes early & asked at what time should we return. That's when she said they were behind & it would be at least 20 minutes. She seemed distracted & turned & left without offering to have us wait in the bar nor mentioning how they would be notifying us when our table was ready. We waited a few minutes more & when she returned my husband asked her if we could sit at the bar, at which point I had already decided we would wait in the bar, as there was clearly availabe seating there. Once we were sitting in the bar area, my husband asked if I'd like to eat there. I said no, that I hadn't made a reservation for the restaurant to have to sit in the bar. I also wasn't sure they'd let us order off the regular menu if we sat there. Long story short, we should have probably just stayed in the bar as the dinner service was atrocious. We were finally escorted to our table at about 9:15 p.m., drinks delivered & order taken at 9:30 p.m. & dinner FINALLY delivered at about 10:30 p.m.! Our server was attentive & checked in with us often, but all we wanted was our dinner! Another gentleman who appeared to be the manager also came by a few times only to mention that our server was new (what did that have to do with anything, unless he was the chef too!), but no real explanation as to why our food was taking so long. My husband had the rib eye steak which he said was good, but not the best he's ever had. I had the filet mignon which was delicious & the only reason why I gave this place more than one star. Overall, we were disappointed...this is not the place it used to be. TIP: Don't go hungry...better yet, DON'T GO AT ALL! We will not be returning & will do our research next time we plan our big night out."
"2","The beer has made a huge improvement! Try the coconut milk stout, it's amazing."
"2","when you think indian restaurant, probably the last thought that comes to mind is amazing cocktail bar!  but Mithas isn't just your average indian, while they do have an outstanding restaurant (sadly which i have yet to try!) they have also extended their venture and a few months previously opened a truly excellent wine and cocktail bar.\n\nentering Mithas is like entering a very swish five star hotel and with a quick turn to the right the bar sits.  loads of dark work and a nicely proportioned seating area with about 4-5 high seats at the actual bar itself.  the wine and cocktail menu is large, but not so large that it's difficult to decide on what you want.  being on a cocktail quest we of course all immediately focused on the two pages of speciality cocktails to decide our drinks.  my first was called Devil's Candy a delicious mixture of gin muddled with pomegranate and mint, a touch of lemon, and topped up with ginger beer.  but the art of the drink was more than just liquid mixed together, my drink was topped with incredibly garnish and a spray of gold dust!  it actually looked like christmas in a glass!!  \n\nmy second drink of the night was a classy martini called the Absolut Passion.  a martini glass dipped in sugar arrived with a mixture of vodka with fresh strawberry puree, fresh passion fruit, and a sweet touch of gomme syrup.  on first sip i was pretty much in love!  this may have been a boozy drink, but it went down an absolute treat!  i definitely would have ordered another if it hadn't been a school night!\n\nin addition to the gorgeous cocktails, the staff at Mithas are incredibly lovely.  very very accomodating and welcoming.  the bartender was an absolute gem mixing up loads of cocktails for our group and the wait staff even brought out a delicious salad with tender chicken for us to enjoy while we drank.  definitely the kind of treatment that you want at such a lovely place.\n\nthe only negative i can see for Mithas wine and cocktail bar is the price.  cocktails started at about \u00a37 which is what most people would expect to pay on george street, but not down in leith.  however, i felt like the quality of the cocktails definitely justified the price and i would happily pop back here for a few pre or post dinner at one of the many restaurants at the shore."
"1","The service was absolutely horrendous. They were 3 hours late with our room and never apologized or gave us any sort of discount. We asked for a late checkout in return for the late room and they said it would be a half days rate.\n\nThe next morning, we called again for a late checkout and the front desk said we could have until 1pm. At around 12pm, security came to our room and said we were supposed to be out. We explained that the front desk had said 1pm and that our room had been 3 hours late. He didnt care and acted like a complete asshole. He called to the front desk and talked to the same girl who gave us the late checkout. She is obviously a real gem too b/c she told security that we didnt have an extension.\n\nAnyways, the service was horrendous. Don't stay here."
"1","Alright DoubleTree, let's keep it real. It appears you may have been recently renovated - but it looks kind of like maybe it was done in a rush (read: shoddy work), your plumbing is simply horrible - my sink doesn't drain, the bathtub filled to my calves while showering (yes, with the drain OPEN), and the maintenance man had to come unclog the toilet last night - seriously, and when I arrived yesterday evening (around 7pm) you gave me a barely warm stale cookie. :(\n\nI love DoubleTree hotels, but what was up with this visit? You must have sensed that I'm a Cleveland Browns fan.\n\nSome helpful hints: \n1. The hotel parking is around the side of the building (on the left if you're facing the front), it's a garage but it's valet only ($22/night on weeknights and $20/night on weekends, if I'm not mistaken).\n2. This hotel is about a six minute walk to Market Square... where you can find some good grub (NOLA, Las Velas, Chipotle, or the classic Primanti Bros. to name a few).\n3. If you need something quick, there's a 7/11 attached to the building and a Dunkin Donuts and Qdoba across the street. \n4. The double beds are tiny (& about as soft as a cot), so request a King if you're coming as a couple.\n5. They give you a key to plug into the wall that turns on the room's electricity - so they're environmentally friendly (or cost conscious perhaps)!\n6. The fitness center is open 24 hours - & includes weight machines, floor mats, ellipticals, stationary bikes, and treadmills.\n7. Flat screen TVs in the guest rooms are a nice touch. The $16.99 they wanted me to pay just to watch Bridesmaids, not so much.\n8. The staff was super friendly and was more than happy to accommodate my late check out (1:30pm) request.\n9. Complimentary Wi-Fi is available throughout the hotel. \n10. There is a shuttle available that services the Downtown Pittsburgh area on a first-come-first-serve basis.\n\nWhile I wasn't impressed - I'll be back for the cookies."
"1","We had multiple casitas/ suites booked for a volleyball tournament. \nWe've been trying to check in since 6:45pm. We were finally given a room by the supervisor that was already occupied. \nIt is now 8:15 and still no room. Left and went back to Hotel Indigo in Scottsdale where customer service matters.\n\nCan not recommend this place if you actually need a room."
"2","Quand j'ai entendu mon amie parler d'un bar sur Crescent et que je n'\u00e9tais super habill\u00e9e pour le genre de bar auquel je pensais aller, je me suis finalement ravis\u00e9e en entrant. Un style int\u00e9rieur \u00e0 la Irish pub, des petites tables \u00e0 4, diff\u00e9rents styles de monde, une bi\u00e8re framboises succulente!\n\nJ'ai \u00e9galement mang\u00e9 un plat d'\u00e9damam\u00e9 (super bons!) ainsi qu'un plat de quesedillas aux champignons succulant! \n\nL'atmosph\u00e8re est convivial et sans pr\u00e9tention. Un endroit o\u00f9 l'on se sent \u00e0 l'aise facilement!"
"2","Great Mexican food in the Chambana area. What is particularly wonderful is the freshness of the ingredients used in the food. Burritos and tacos are on the menu of course, but the carne asada and fajita plates are wonderful.\n\nParking is difficult (there are only a few spots) and at times there may be a long line, takeout service is quick - you can also call ahead and your order will be ready for pick-up when you arrive."
"2","Had Carolina's for lunch yesterday.  Just happened to be downtown with some clients I am consulting for.  Got the beef enchilada combo.  The food was great as always.  I usually go for the burros, although I rarely get through a foot long (who could?).\n\nMy colleagues got cheese enchiladas and chicken tacos.  Everyone was very happy with the food, and we all left stuffed.  They even paid!  The only thing better then lunch at Carolina's is a free lunch at Carolina's."
"1","So absolutely disappointing."
"2","This locale is within walking distance of my apartment complex. The lobby area is nice but I don't go in very much at all. The drive thru is quick and easy.....friendly service.....no hassle ATM'S and considering it is located on the corner of a major thorough fare it is very safe to conduct your outside transactions here. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!"
"2","5 Guys Burgers and Fries cooks their hamburgers and fries in peanut oil.  The company is based in Virginia, and promotes Virginia agriculture.  The burgers are big, juicy and very tasty.  The fries are OK.  The soda machine is very cool - they are computer-controlled you can mix and match ALOT of different flavors.  Come with wipes, because they are messy!"
"1","a french bistro is judged on his pomme frites and ours were soggy and not all that hot either....service was ok - how hard is it to serve the lady first in a party of two? pot de creme was yummy but caramel tart was not good.....on the plus side, the decor is nice and the mushroom risotto was delicious.....not sure i would go back when Mon Ami is right across the street"
"1","We arrived at Jade on Sunday evening.  The restaurant didn't seem too busy, but we were not greeted by a hostess.  Instead a waiter rushed us to our table.  After getting somewhat settled, one of the waiters brought us glasses of water.  However, the water ended up falling all over the table and us.  Our laps were soaked.  The waiter apologized and changed our table, but that was the only gesture that was made to improve our experience (e.g., no manager was on site to speak with us, we were not offered any complimentary items, we were not compensated for any portion of our meal).  Service for the rest of the dinner was mediocre at best, and while we tried to wait to place our order and to request the check, we had to seek his attention multiple times.\n\nMaybe this was off night but this makes no excuse to have such shoddy service and to not have a system in place to help make the consumer's experience more enjoyable.  As a side note, I thought the food was decent (3.5 stars), but I would never come back."
"1","Went here because of the great reviews and was very disappointed. Felt more like your average Denny's restaurant turned buffet than a world class dining experience. Besides the made-to-order omelette station which seems to be standard fare at any buffet establishment, their offerings were not very extensive, nor were they remotely tasty... some inedible. Probably doesn't help that my wife and I went to the Wicked Spoon the day before for the weekend brunch... now that's a place that does a proper buffet - HIGHLY recommend it! Go to Wicked Spoon, not the Belaggio."
"2","Top notch buffet* so glad I came here.\nRoasted bone marrow !!! Soooo amazing.\nI put it on toast and it was a true revelation.\nLots of good choices.\n.charcuterie !! \n.siracha lime watermelon- Mmmm mmm\n.roasted meats-turkey,sirloin well seasoned \n.some Asian selections-all very tasty \n.nice salad bar with some nice cheeses\n.nice desert section\n\nPlace inside is very nice, a lilts but of walking to get to, but definitely worth the wait"
"2","Can't say enough about this place! Been coming here for several years now. The staff is always friendly and you can't say no to Thrifty ice cream! Water is amazing and the place is always clean!"
"2","Awesome burgers!!!!!!!!"
"2","I've had my hair cut by Scott 4 times now and he does a great job, I've never had anyone ask me where I've gotten my haircut before, but now they do. He recommended a scissor over comb( or comb over scissor?)\nCut, no quickie buzz cut. I've recommend some female coworkers and they drive all the way from chandler for him to do their hair. I've never had anyone give me suggestions about how I should wear my hair or ways to minimize that growing BALD spot but he does. Every time I walk out of there I feel better about the way i look and my shirt isn't soaked, he does this head massage when they wash your hair that is just great, and I cant tell you how long it's been since the owner of a business has come over and introduced themselves and asked if I wanted a drink or coffee from Starbucks. I look forward to getting my haircut now!"
"2","Located next to Target this book store has a nice selection of both used and heavily discounted new books as well as music, calendars and other fun stuff. This is not like going into one of the big chains where you can sit down drink coffee and read their product. Store is a little small. You may bump into someone if you are spacing out. Just say excuse me and continue enjoying yourself.\n\nI love to get my cookbooks here when I am experimenting with a new type of ethnic cuisine. They also have several selections by famous chefs and TV shows that you would see on some of the cable channels. Picked up a Triple \""D\"" cookbook on my last visit. Nice.\n\nToday I picked up several books out of the kids section for my new granddaughter. Had to get some Curious George in fact a bunch of them. They were only $1.99 each. These were my favorite as a child. Who doesn't like stories about a Monkey that gets into trouble and his pal The Man in the Yellow Hat.\n\nWhen you get tired of your old books you can trade them in or sell them for cash. Trade in is always a better value and then you can walk out with a fresh batch of reading material in the same visit.\n\nThey may not have exactly what you are looking for but it is always worth doing a quick pop in to see. You never know what you may score. Ding! Turn the page."
"1","First off, I asked for aisle seats live and in person at the box office. When we arrived, we found that we were indeed at the end of a row, but not an aisle.  We had to climb over 12 people to get to our seats, which made it very uncomfortable when we walked out in the middle of the performance.... very boring.\n\nEvery seat in this theater-in-the-round has partially obstructed views\n\nDo not get me wrong, the acrobats are very talented and I am a big fan of Mystere, O and KA, but even the failed Elvis show was better than this.\n\nDo not waste your money!"
"2","For being a chain restaurant, CB is pretty awesome. I love the variety in their menu (sometimes I stare at it, unable to decide). And for someone who isn't a good cook (me!), it's nice to go out for an affordable, home-cooked meal. \n\nI love the country store attached to the restaurant. Fun to browse, and I've found some great birthday/holiday gifts there, too!"
"2","Super honest, friendly, and laid back. Brought my truck in for an alignment, but needed some very obvious additional work which they brought me into their garage to show me firsthand. Bob, is wicked knowledgeable and knows his stuff. I won't be taking my vehicles anywhere else from now on."
"1","Service- The girls there are always nice and friendly, the food comes out pretty fast, but sometimes the breakfast burritos aren't always what you order so make sure you check your bag before you leave or else. It usually stays clean inside and out.\n\nFood-I've tried everything, but nothing really makes me want to come back, I only go back for my grandparents who seem to just accept this place as a mexican joint near the house. Id' say if the hot sauce went to the tomatoe type hot sauce and they had chips, it would help as well as a smaller choice of tacos with \""homemade tortillas\"" it would separate themselves as an acceptable mexican restaurant.\n\nAs you can see I don't have much to say about a certain type of plate because they are easily forgettable. STEP UP your game a little my friends. Although, I'll still come back with my grandparents. This is my review."
"2","best place around for anything rental or for party decorations. their inventory is very large and everything is in great shape and condition. staff is helpful and friendly. we like to support local businesses!"
"1","I had low expectations, but I don't feel those were even met.  The food here is greasy and over-cooked, and not all that appetizing. I had the Fish and Chips platter, and the scallops in particular were mushy.  The service was very good.  The prices were fairly high.    I'm not a fan of Joe's."
"2","I was wowed on a few levels... I have been looking for a Jazz bar for a bit and had to check this place out. Live jazz singers ans musicians on Wed, Fri, and Sat. Yes these are quality performers! I heard some great performances of classic songs and some original material. The live music starts at about 10:30pm on Fri and Sat and goes till about 2am with a couple short breaks between sets. \n\nThey have a good drink selection and the prices are very reasonable. If you get a little hungry, as I often do when having a few drinks, they have a number of things to choose from. The bartender and waitress were friendly and accommodating.\n\nThe atmosphere is relaxed and although the place gets a crowd, its not too packed as to become disruptive to listening to the great music. The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because of the positioning of the stage... The musicians are kind of tucked back in the corner and hard to see."
"2","I just moved to  Henderson NV and am getting married next week, so it was really important for me to find someone who could bring life back again to my drab hair - it was dry, my roots were showing, and I had tons of split ends. \n\nBoy am I glad I found Aspen Salon! Jan (Wood) did an AMAZING job on my hair - she knew exactly what base color and highlights would go with my skin, she was super fast and efficient with the whole process (she has 40 years experience so she def knows what she's doing!), she listened to what I wanted hair-wise but gave the right amount of expert advice. She was extremely organized and neat with everything which shows just how professional she is. Plus I seriously love all the products that she used on me too - all high-end, awesome-smelling stuff. All in all, she really just took care of me the whole time and made me look beautiful, and gabbed with me like we were long-time friends :)\n\nCheck out Groupon for Aspen's awesome deals. Though I can totally say that the experience, service and hair treatment I got was totally worth the original price.\n\nThanks so much for beautifying me for my big day, Jan! Be blessed all the time!"
"2","I really thought they were my favorite pizza of all time. Ordering a whole pizza- it was a cheesy mess of amazing. SO GOOD.  BUT I had a big disappointing visit last time. We are too poor to afford 30 dollar pizza all the time so when we need a fix we went in for slices.  I got the pizza in the rack when you first walk in.   My crust was so hard and chewy it was obvious it was old pizza. Like bad old pizza. Like all day sitting out old pizza.  So I still like the whole pie, but mineo's can give me both good pie AND slices. I know its a pizza war out there in sq. Hill, but I think I have finally picked a side. Mineo's for me please."
"1","I was so excited to try this place out for my best friend's 22nd birthday, but I was really disappointed. We had a reservation for 12 people, but the birthday girl and I got there 5 minutes early so we could sit at the table and be ready when everyone got there. The hostess was very rude and said we were too early and that we needed at least half of our party to be seated. Firstly, 5 minutes is too early?!?! Secondly, when we had 5 people she would not seat us, because we needed 1 more person... \nWhen we finally had 7 people she looked us up and down very disapprovingly (probably because we weren't in skimpy clothes) and walked us to our table.\nThe place was packed and very busy, and our waiter was running around a little frantic. I understand it's busy, so that didn't bother me much. He was really great and said happy birthday to the birthday girl and apologized for not coming sooner. We all ordered some pretzel bread, which was amazingggg, and some drinks and he was really excited for us to be there. However, we didn't order a second round of drinks and he got very cold and started to become almost rude. Apparently if you're not a big drinker don't go there, even if you order $300 worth of food. Overall, wouldn't go back or recommend, but the decor was awesome."
"2","This store has lots of interesting things to buy besides frames. I went in to get a frame for a beautiful painting my 12 year old made. The lady working there asked me what type I wanted (white and not too expensive) and showed me several nice frames.  She was very helpful and I'll definitely go back to see their other goodies when I have more time!"
"1","The first time we went here we samples all of the different juices, and the owner sold us on the cleanse package, telling us that if we returned the bottles, that they would give us $1 off per bottle. \n\nWhen we got home late afternoon, we noticed 4 of the juices expired that day, and we needed to drink them that evening (not thrilled).  We didn't get the chance to drink them all in time before they expired. \n\nWe decided for us, we would prefer to go buy the juice that we intend to drink instantly. When we went back today, we brought the 12 bottles back, and just wanted 2 drinks.  They told us that they would take the 12 bottles ($12 off), but only give us $2 off this order, with a receipt showing an additional 10 bottles returned.  I explained that we only intend to buy drinks as we drink them, so we won't ever buy 12 at a time again.  They said \""that's fine, but we can't give you the discount\"".\n\nBottom line:  they are willing to give a discount of $1 per bottle returned. But they will only do it bottle for bottle, meaning that they try to lock you in to buying bulk. I hate small businesses that hide behind bate-n-lock-in \""policy\"" over common sense and putting the customer first. \n\nCustomer service is poor here."
"1","Where to start?!!!! \nWe went there January 1 when Tiesto was playing. We were on guest list. They told us arrive 9.30, door open 10.30. That's not bad. So we got there like they ask. Line was long, no biggie. Line was moving so slow. Took as almost 4 hours to get there. What kinda guest list it is?!!!!!! Ridicules !!!   \nAll staff was rude!!!! \nWhen we got inside it was so many people that you can't walk around !!! Why they have so many people there? Not safe at all!!!! \nI am giving * for Tiesto only. He was amazing . The best!!!! Just love him and that's why I stand in line- for him ONLY!!! \nIf not for him I will give -*. Terrible place to be!!!!"
"2","I had an amazing experience with Perfect Hair and Makeup! They are a great team! They were on time and I showed them pictures of how I wanted to look and they worked magic :). They are professional and friendly and made me look and feel so beautiful for my wedding! I am still getting compliments 2 weeks later. I read the Yelp reviews and chose them and that is why I'm writing this, they were all around awesome."
"2","make your own pizza! wow this is such a good price for the size of the pizza and what you want on it! they give you so much toppings compared to any other pizza joints. the only trouble i had was to take it home! it barely fit in the passenger seat so i had to drive carefully and not to slam on the breaks so i wont lose my dinner lol. ALSO im a small asian and this pizza is bigger than me! \n\nit took awhile to cook at home. i baked it in the oven it was a bit watery so i put my slice in the small toaster to dry it up a bit and to make the crust crispy. pizza is better when the crust is a bit crispy. \n\noverall i like this pizza place! \n\nif your starving and want to eat pizza right away... this isnt the place for you cuz you have to bake it yourself!"
"2","DA BESS' LOCAL KINE GRINDZ ON DA MAINLAND. Same owners as \""Aloha Specialties\"" in The California hotel.

"1","Except for being new, there is nothing special there.  One dance floor with two levels of booths around it.  Music was good - a nice mix of all styles.  Drinks are pricy - $16 for red bull vodka.  The \""free\"" passes that they give out everywhere give you some discount ($10), but that totally depends on the bouncers at the door.  Waitresses are good looking and extremely cocky.  But after all, that is Vegas - a fake glamorous city."
"2","Love Love Love getting a massage by Dana! She creates such a deep connection when I'm on the table it becomes very easy to open up to her, body wise, as well as spirit.  I usually prefer male therapists, but Dana is the exception for me. For sure one of the best therapists in the Valley!! Please do yourself a favor, and book at least an 80 min with Dana, and be prepared for some amazing massage and energy work!!"
"2","I recently made a reservation for my birthday and was pleasantly surprised! Raymond was fantastic. He met us at baggage claim and assisted with all 10 of our bags! To my surprise we were upgraded from a 6 passenger limo to the stretch SUV! Talk about a birthday treat! His service was amazing and I tried requesting him for our return trip. I only rated this review with 4 stars as the return trip was lack luster :( Also if you want champagne be sure to request it in advance otherwise you'll receive Cider."
"2","Soooo freaking great! Think chipotle, you choose an enchilada, taco, chopped salad or tortilla soup, add the homemade INCREDIBLE meat and extras and boom you've got an iron chefs version of chipotle for close to the same price! And the grapefruit margarita was unreal!!"
"2","Really good burritos.  I think they are pretty comparable to Chipotle, but better than Moe's and Qdoba.  The burritos are usually huge, although you occassionally get someone who makes them a little smaller.  Same for the burrito bowls.  They also have $2 tacos after 4, which is a good deal."
"2","they have the best soup. tge salsa is amazing. toasted and roasted and whatnot. i like the taco and soup combo. he likes the coastal trio. yum!!!"
"1","This Wendy's is very nice  and new. We usually like this place but this occasion we found a bone in our chicken sandwich. We gave it to the man cleaning the lobby. He took it to his supervisor/ manager and know one approached us with an apology or questions. This was in bad taste and we will not be back"
"2","Yes, I've been bitten by \""come, enjoy and possibly take a nap in our recliners\"" bug. I hate to admit it as I really hate lazy boy chairs, but the recliners in a movie theater are an awesome idea. Another thing I hate are mall theaters, especially the ones with hidden, narrow, basement like entrance. Well apparently I hated them until I got to this one.\n\nTook my son to see Frozen. It looked crammed when we opened the door and got in, but the line moved so quick that in about 30 seconds we were at the ticket counter. Impressive. I love that you pick seats, even tho we couldn't pick two seats together (that's what you get for being late). However the nice lady that had seat next to my son offered to switch seats with me - another win! Kids seem to like the soda machines, I like that it adds up to clean and upgraded look. The show rooms seem smaller than in other AMCs but I prefer that. The reclining chairs are nice and clean. Even if you put them all the way down, there is still about 12in space in front, in case someone needs to go by. I did not see any leftover popcorn or garbage.\n\nThe only thing that sucked is that bathrooms are really small, just 2-3 stalls. But hey, not everything can be perfect I guess"
"2","I like having a village in close to where I live for times when I'm in the mood for breakfast, but don't feel like cooking it. They've recently updated the place to have kind of a retro/modern feel...new paint, new pictures, new booths - I like it! I don't really like their new logo, but I'm not there to eat their logo so I'll get used to it eventually. Also, they have free wi-fi here if that's important to you. \n\nFood is always good, love their pancakes, and a lot of menu items to choose from. I tried the new chicken ranch sandwich - yums! This place was pretty busy around Saturday 11am. I've heard they have a free slice of pie on Weds type deal, so maybe one of these days I'll check that out."
"2","Amazing food for a great price. Lingua, shrimp, ribs you want it they've basically got it."
"1","I stayed in Tower II - Widescreen remodeled room. It looks much nicer than the regular rooms. But the first thing we noticed was a blood stain on the sheet, which they quickly replaced after a call. The shower had very low water pressure and there was no tub. Also no fridge or microwave. The iron was messed up/ no steam button. \n\nThe smell of the lobby is pretty bad. It smells more like dust and smoke than most of the other hotels. The crowd there is pretty ghetto. I wouldn't bring kids here but then again I wouldn't take kids to Vegas! They were arresting some cholo just a few doors down, escorting him out of the room.\n\nTo top it off, the front desk customer service lady wanted to charge us $25 for a one hour later check out... on a Sunday! Then she lied about being the manager when we asked to speak to the Manager. \n\nOn a positive note.. it's a good place on the strip if you want to stay on the South side. The bed was very comfy and the flat screen TV was cool. But who watches TV in Vegas?\n\nBottomline.. I won't stay there again."
"2","Ok, i've only been here once, but i loved it! Can't wait to go back. I'll up date my review then...\n\nUpdate: been back a couple times. It's still good. Service, atmosphere, and location are all great. The menu is huge and pretty good. It's a tribute to supper clubs, but i don't really get the supper club feel so much.\nGet the deep-fried cheese curds, they are the best in town!!"
"1","Right when I entered, the bartender greeted us and ask us to choose a table or bar. The place was pretty decent size and it was very dark inside. With the heat ugh not good. It was so hot inside there. Very uncomfortable. The bartender was very nice though. They had a happy house menu at the bar.  I tried the BBQ pulled pork sliders. It was came with 2 pork sliders and taro chips. It was very good. 3.5/5 . I also tried the Carne Asada wontons 3/5. This place seem like there potential. An A/C would be a start."
"2","I'm a chocoholic, and this is by far the best place for people like me. The menu is full of options that it's hard for me to settle for just one. I went in with some friends and thankfully we all tried different items and I loved them all!! Can't wait to go back!"
"2","Oh Bobby Flay, you truly deserve to be an iron chef.  Had the NY steak and it was so so delicious.  Hubby had the rib eye and just the look of it made me want to eat it all.  The corn thingy side was so good, as was the mashed potatoes.  The fundito was really good too, as were the chicken skewers.  Not really crazy for the tamales though.  But regardless, the service and the food were so good, and the price wasn't as bad as I thought it might be so go Bobby!!!"
"1","This place used to taste much better, now its just kinda plain and greasy.. You do get big portions for a good price... I was not impressed the last few times I was here, and I was starving. \n\nThey have coupons on the take out menus.. you can get something free ( egg rolls) for spending over $15..  but you need to ask for it.\n\nIt smells kinda funky inside... and servers cashiers could be nicer."
"2","coming from LA, me and my coworker were craving for some tandoori chicken and naan. Yelp and found this place. I have tried plenty of Indian cuisine and I would say this taste pretty bland. But again, its in Az and the lunch buffet have fair choices of vege and non vege food. Plus point, they bring out fresh naan. Yum :)"
"2","The Cosmopolitan is gorgeous, and Milos is right up with it. The restaurant is classy and clean and beautiful. The service is excellent and the food is really good. We went for lunch and wow, I want to go for dinner. Their lunch is perfect, I had the bass and it was out of this world.  \n\nI really can't say enough nice things about this restaurant  so go and try it ;)"
"2","This place is every college student's dream: cheap, large portion and right on campus! And the service is fast and efficient. \n\nI always get my usual: a samosa and a large order of chicken makhani over white rice. Chicken makhani is my favorite and I highly recommend if you like creamy sauces! \n\nAlso you have the option of a small or large order. I would get a large because for just a dollar more, you get twice the amount of food, enough for lunch and dinner!"
"1","I was disappointed in this restaurant. I realize that it's pub food, but still. I think that, like everyone has said, Gordon Ramsay needs to come back and whip the ex Hell's Kitchen winner back into shape. \n\nWe made a reservation for 1 pm and we wound up missing one of our people. We told our waiter that we were just going to order/eat without him, and it took so long for him to take our orders. \n\nMy fiance liked the bangers and mash, the fish and chips were a little sour tasting (weird). If you go, you should order the duck poutine, that was the best thing!"
"2","Very good sports bar. The bartenders are awesome, friendly, and they make everyone feel comfortable especially Kelly-Ann. Generous servings with good prices. The owner is very personable and makes everyone feel welcomed. St.Patricks Day is a must. The entire parking lot is tented off and there is entertainment all day long. Padre Murphy's is a great place for a game, pay per view fights, off track betting and live entertainment. Without a doubt one if not the best sports bar in North Phoenix. What I like most is Padre Murphy's is not a boring corporate business, but a locally own establishment, which to me makes the place stand out from all the others. I really liked the fish and chips(all you can eat) on Fridays, and the corned beef sandwich. If your looking for a game on tv, Padre Murphy's is the place to be."
"1","Worse pedicure ever!   This place is nothing but a factory.  I had been there once and swore I would never go back. Went to my regular salon and they were closed for remodeling so needed one fast for an occasion.  Polish at Stonecrest is close by so I thought I would give it another try.   Mistake.  The male that did my pedicure talked to the girls working there and paid no attention to what he was doing. Clipped a little on my toes, \""massaged\"" my legs for about 1/2 minute each and moved on.   My feet looked no better than when I arrived!  The whole process took about 20 minutes! \nThat is my last visit there.   A waste of money."
"2","The Garlic Pork is very good. My family picks this as one of their favorite places to eat."
"1","Every time I've walked past this place it's absolutely dead inside. And given that the place is a) so big and b) crammed so full with as many chairs and tables as is humanly possible, this just makes it look even worse. In fact, I could probably count on one hand the number of times I've seen this place with more customers in it than staff.\n\nOn first impressions, you don't understand why. Eat there though, and it soon becomes clear. \n\nMy main criticism is that it's quite simply over-priced. I went in once with a friend to take advantage of their \""Free Maki with any Coffee\"" deal, which all seemed great until you find out that a coffee alone is almost \u00a35!\n\nThis pricing continues across the board - for 1 sashimi dish you'll pay anything up to \u00a39, which you wouldn't mind if the food had some good (or at least any!) flavour to it. But compared to other nearby Japanese restaurants, like Tang's or Bonsai, this place just doesn't really do it for me at all."
"1","Never was able to find out if they were any good. I called to make a Saturday appointment- They don't take New patients on Sat. I only wanted Sat so I don't have to take off work. So I'll set up with a different Dentist. \n                                                           Arrivederci Davinci!\n\n\n\nI could not come into the business without taking a day off work, but I can pass on my  experience (phone and scheduling) on yelp. Even if you no longer do any Saturday appointments."
"1","Although quaint with some items tasty, we've decided not to go here anymore based on them serving foie gras.  Many of the better restaurants are straying from serving this plate as it entails forcefeeding ducks by shoving a feeding tube down their throat and esophagus. Much more gruesome details I won't mention because most people don't care anyway.  There are some of us meat eaters that do not wish to eat flesh from tortured animals and thank goodness there are enough other great restaurants around who will no longer serve this."
"1","Oh Dal Toro you really let me down! Went to Dal Toro with the family for my mothers birthday dinner, it sounded like a cool place with all of the high end cars to look at and we all love a good Italian restaurant. We were seated in a private room, off to the right once you walk in, it seemed cool until we realized they would forget about us constantly. We bought a Groupon for this place ($90 for $200) which is the only reason this place got 2 stars from me, only one time we had our water refilled, two of our orders wrong and we were neglected the entire time there. \n\nI ordered a very simple dish, Fettucini Alfredo w/chicken and shrimp, my sister ordered a steak well done. I got my Fettucini with no chicken on it and my sister got her steak much later than the rest of us and it was medium almost medium rare. I told him I didn't get the chicken he said the cook must've over looked it. A few minutes later I got the chicken when I was almost done with my pasta and it tasted like it had been left out for days, disgusting! I told him right away and asked him to just remove it from the table and from the bill, he gave me this look of confusion and irritation. The manager took my sisters steak and said, \""Oh this is terrible, this isn't well done at all. We'll get a new one out for you asap.\"" Yea, they just threw the same steak on the grill and brought it back to her, with a disaster presentation. She had a few bites and it wasn't good at all so she just left it and they didn't care.\n\nFinally the bill came, my chicken was still on the bill, so I decided to take it to the manager I was done dealing with a server that was in lala land. The manager took him the bill and asked him to remove the chicken and bring us a new bill. The server that was so polite when we first sat down was no longer polite but very rude and irate. The bad part of all this because we were 6 people his gratuity was already included at 20%, with terrible service and an attitude like that he didn't deserve 2%! This place doesn't care about the satisfaction of their customers and doesn't take pride in their food."
"2","Love this Starbucks for the business vibe! Lots of meetings going on. More than enough outlets for your laptop, but always crowded, so finding one is tough. Love the upscale feel."
"1","boo to our drinks with friends meeting. there were 9 of us. we met on the beautiful outside patio of Province. we had no plans for food, but i will preface by saying on a previous dining experience, the food was stellar. \n\nservice was horrendous. we did get water...plenty of it. a server kept coming to the table with trays of water glasses, offering to get us more water. 30 minutes later, a member of our party finally went to the restaurant to get drink menus which we then waited and waited again for a server to get our drink orders. \nnormally i don't put up with this nonsense and just leave, but 2 of our friends had their kids across the street at the YMCA and we wanted to visit with them before they had to collect their younguns. we quickly killed our drinks when they finally arrived because by that time, our couple friend had to go pick up their kids. \n\ni guess this time was a miss."
"2","LOVE THIS PLACE! Great atmosphere, the fish tank at the center of the restaurant is really cool...waitstaff and managers were extremely friendly...only waited 5 minutes for a table with no reservatfion on saturday night last week...drinks were delish! had their top shelf mojito YUM and my friend had their special bloody mary and loved it...menu was unique...we went with the soup trio -clam chowder (pretty good), lobster bisque (very good) and gazpacho (amazing)!!! I had the short ribs and scallops for dinner and was really good as well...the short ribs did have a burnt kind of taste but was still good...and the scallops were soooo good...i'd def go back again!"
"1","So far our dealings with ULI have been a nightmare, including a signed lease that says June 1 even though we are now told our lease doesn't start until July 1 and prior to that an apartment showing appointment (that we had paid $400 to fly up from Ohio) in which they blew us off. We received no apologies for either instance. \n\nMe, my boyfriend, our real estate agent, and my boyfriend's mother have dealt with them all on different occasions throughout this process and each person has been treated terribly.\n\nWe flew up to Madison specifically to look for apartments and even had a real estate agent schedule a viewing with ULI on a Monday starting at 2 PM for the entire afternoon to look at like 6 different properties. We showed up at 2, and called after about 15 minutes of waiting. They said \""Sorry, we had you at 1 PM and now we can't legally enter anyone's apartment.\"" Our real estate agent had just confirmed with them on Friday. Being that we really wanted to rent from a specific property of theirs, we didn't have much of a choice but to be dragged around by their horrible customer service. We ended up having a friend visit at a later date and record video of apartments with his iPhone. \n\nBased off our friend's videos, we signed a lease and before we booked our moving truck, we just wanted to confirm that they received all of our paperwork and deposit (since we heard nothing from them) and also to see if we could move in 1 day earlier than our June 1 start date. I just received a call back saying \""I pulled the tenant's file and they have the lease through July 1\"" -- ARE YOU KIDDING ME? We SIGNED a lease for June 1 and now after they took our money they are telling us our lease doesn't start in until July 1. So they literally promised one tenant they could stay until July 1 and yet promised us that we could move in June 1. Luckily the current tenants are moving out after the first week of June. ULI said they are still going to charge us for the month of June. \n\nTHANKS for the awesome start to a one-year lease ULI! Can't wait to see what other surprises you bring on us!"
"2","NOTE, this review is for UP dinner. \n\nA good thing about this restaurant is you can choose down dinner or up dinner, down dinner is casual, and inexpensive, up dinner is dressy and expensive.\n\nWe made a reservation a couple hours before our reservation, we stayed at THE hotel. Got there, downstairs was packed, host thought we were tourists who didn't speak English, she was very friendly to us, asked if we wanted to eat here with a hand pose showing ''eating'', that was so funny :) bf said we had a reservation upstairs, then she took us to our table.\n\nFood: 5\nService: 5\nDecor: 5\nAmbience: 5\n\nTotal bill for 4 people with 4 alcohol beverages: $415\n\nwe went  upstairs, the entire dining section  was so classic and beautiful. there weren't so many ppl, only a few tables ppl were having dinners, and they were older. We got a very cozy and comfy booth, more private too, perfect for our double dinner date evening. \n\nWhile waiting for our friends, I ordered dry vodka martini as usual. our server was so friendly, explained everything on the menu, even where the fish came from, or veggies, that was very interesting. He helped us to order the right things from the menu, I had salad and salmon as first and second course, they tasted fantastic. my bf had scallop and roasted duck , they were the same great. our friends had halibut and some other seafood as well, everybody was happy with our dinner. we shared a little bit of everything too, cause the portions were big. \n\none of my favorite restaurants in Mandalay bay, up dinner is so nice, great food, great service, beautiful decor, quiet and cozy atmosphere,  it is pricey, but very well worth it. :)\n\nvery nice choice for a romantic, quiet, cozy and intimate dinner date. :)"
"2","*3.5 rounded up*\n\nMy heart still tears up when I recall the marvel that was Tapino, and I keep on hoping that a tapas bar would appear that rivaled it one day.  \n\nBut, July 22nd was not the day, and Tapas Papa Frita was not the much hoped-for rival.  \n\nDon't get me wrong, Tapas Papa Frita is a solid choice for tapas in the valley.  The menu, though for the most part unoriginal, contains a few little tidbits for the more adventurous eaters, such as oxtail (oxtail????).  \n\nMy friend J and I started with a Sangria, and perhaps if we didn't order a *$22* pitcher of Sangria, I might have been more enthusiastic about the value of the place.  However, a mediocre, very fruity Sangria was ordered, and drunk in good time; there was enough in there for a little more than 2 glasses each.  \n\nFrom the tapas menu, we ordered the calamari rings, the spanish meatballs, and potato pie (in English :-), no need to embarass our gringo waiter with our gringo pronunciations.  \n\nThe calamari rings were friend to a light gold, perfect, and it came with a trio of dipping sauces that consisted of a vegetable compost (mostly eggplant), a spicy marinara (though more spice than marinara), and an aioli, which was disappointing as far as aioli goes.  They were well worth the $6.  The meatball, however, was entirely unoriginal, though entirely soaked in a hearty marinara.  I probably wouldn't order that again.  The potato pie deserves a 4.5 star based on novelty alone!  I love potatoes, and I love pie.  Who knew? :-)  The only flaw, really, in their potato pie was the cream aioli served on top.  If you must have a bland item like potato, at least have an interesting dipping sauce, or something that complements it, instead of being simply a limp bystander.\n\nWe also ordered the Valenciana paella.  It was brought to the table still haughty in its pan.  On their menu, they list the the dish as a \""masterpiece\"", and, sigh, it's good, just not masterpiece-worthy.\n\nOn the plus side, I probably would have given them 4 stars without the $22 Sangria."
"2","We are visiting and so excited to have found the Street.  I am a big fan of the bob smoothie.  I have been here two days and have had a boba smoothie every day.  Delicious."
"2","Great Breakfast! They even leave water and a coffee pot at your table. They had new hash brown potatoes today. The old one were like fried chips. The new ones are 100% better love them. As for the protein pancake a must try it's great."
"1","Sadly, I have to update my Curry Zen review. On our last visit, we were treated really poorly by the staff and it really soured me on the restaurant overall.\n\nWe arrived in the evening when they were pretty busy but there were two empty seats at the counter. The waiter who sat us asked US if anyone was before us in line for a table- um, how should we know? There were two guys hanging around outside but they could have been waiting for take-out or something else, and it's not my job to keep track of your customers for you. Also I just got here?\n\nSo anyway, he sat us and took our drink order... and then suddenly remembered that there WERE other customers in line for a table and made us get up and leave. I was completely appalled at how unprofessional and absurd this behavior was. We were seated and had our order taken! He kind of acted like we did this on purpose, too, like we were trying to sneak ahead of the other customers. It was just gross.\n\nEven if I still lived in the area, I would never eat at Curry Zen again. One bonus star for being yummy and introducing me to Japanese curry, which I've since enjoyed at several other restaurants."
"1","the oysters were very good and fresh.. but nothing to rave over.. the fries, while had an interesting presentation in a crepe holder were average at best.. i was still hungry went i left.......but not for more bouchon .. overrated....\n\n\nyes it was lovely with high ceilings and a pretty view of the pool but this is Vegas.. u need something more to impress than here..."
"2","Every time I go to Vegas, I literally demand to eat here. If I don't get the chance to eat here, I will probably go from a 5 foot 2 inch girl to a 10 foot hulk-monster-type creature (w/ pink lipstick).\n\nFirst things first: The crab legs here are to die for. Die for! I mean where else can you get crab legs that are already sliced down the middle and warmed? The meat is juicy and salty with a hint of sweetness, such perfection should be a hell-sent sin. This is the only place I go to satisfy my urge for crab legs. All the other foods are just great, they have different sections for the different ethnic foods (because racial grouping is only natural even in foods) and I don't remember putting something in my mouth that I didn't like. Prime rib and aus jus was juicy and full of flavor, the perfect combination. The line is never sickeningly long, it's always a moderate length.\n\nOh, If I could describe every single thing I ate at this buffet I could publish it into a book but for your sake I won't. Just trust me and try this buffet. You'll get your money's worth.\n\nBTW: They have unlimited Gelato! And cotton candy to take home! (faint!)"
"1","I visited Harmon a year ago this month when I was in Vegas and the actual visit was fine, but the billing has been a NIGHTMARE. Here's the summary: it took MONTHS for me to finally get a bill that was accurate. I paid this bill in February 2012 (for a visit that was in June 2011!). Today I just got a bill for the exact amount that I already paid. Now I've been trying to actually get a hold of someone to clear this up, which is almost as painful as the food poisoning that led me to the urgent care in the first place. Beware--check your bill closely, keep good records of payment history, stay in touch with your insurance company, and expect to have a difficult time getting a hold of an actual person."
"2","Being a native of Louisiana, I find the hospitality and decor a great remider of home. The atmosphere, food, and overall customer service makes this a perfect place to unwind after a long day, or meet with friends. \n\nFor starters  you must order the Voodoo Doll drink (very smooth),  and Red Beans (SEASONED JUST RIGHT). \n\nDon't judge me becuase I also had the catfish entree and it was great, especially paired with the mashed potatoes. Now in Louisiana we take pride in our food and especially desserts and the beignets are as good as the orginial Cafe Du Monde.  \n\nI love this place!!!"
"1","We have dined at this Flemings location numerous times before and had wonderful experiences, however, this time things fell very flat.  Things started off fine with water and a wine list that was provided via Ipad.  My fiance's mother asked the waitress for wine recommendations and she wasn't able to help ( it seemed like she wasn't too familiar with the selection).  Ordering food was fairly quick and easy.  Once we received our steaks, the waitress informed us about the lava cake that takes 20 minutes to cook, and told us she would check back in shortly to see if we were interested.  We didn't see her again for at least 30 minutes. \n\nI know, I know.  When people usually say 30 minutes they are grossly overestimating out of frustration; however, we actually did wait that long.  So long in fact, it began to get awkward at the table.  All the food was consumed and our wine glasses were empty, yet our waitress was nowhere in sight.  When she did finally show, it was too late to order the lava cake.  We instead ordered two plates of creme brulee and two desserts to go, along with a cup of coffee.  The coffee was cold, and it took 10 minutes to get a new hot cup.  Once dessert was finished we again were left waiting around for our waitress; waiting to clear dishes, waiting to receive the check, and again, waiting to pay the check.  In all it took us two hours to have a simple meal, and that was not by choice.  \n\nThe food was great, per usual, but the service was just downright bad."
"1","Would never use again. Needed to mail via usps. Was told one package was more expensive because they couldn't bend it so it had to go parcel post. Told them I've neve had that happen at post office or other stores. Lady told me I was lucky but this is how it needs to go. Told her if I wasn't in a hurry I'd go elsewhere.  The guy working didn't know how to do the  postage. Horrible experience."
"2","SOOO happy I found this place. It's the most authentic Thai food I have found so far in AZ (just moved here in 2013 from San Francisco.\nI spent 10 days in Thailand, and I took 2 months of private Thai cooking lessons. I'm a bit of a Thai food snob.\n\nThe food here is very tasty.\nThe Larb salad was a bit fishey (heavy on the fish sauce) for my taste.\nThe red curry with pineapple is divine!\nThe papaya salad is really well done\nPad See Yu (spelling?) is REALLY good\npepper stir-fry is okay, very peppery (not my choice to order this)\nThe eggplant stir-fry was half really good, and half under-cooked.\n\nI'll be coming back here to try more of the menu.\nService is also really good."
"1","To the venues credit, it wasnt terrible looking.\n\nHowever, if you are a dancer here, especially on the night we went and especially in a town where Uptown Cabaret is just a short drive away, then please finish college and get a different job.\n\nYou are obviously very unattractive and/or did some stupid shit that landed you in this venue that (not literally) stunk of desperation.\n\nIf this is \""The Gold Club\"", then what the hell does the silver or bronze look like? Avoid this place if you can."
"1","Nails here are good but slow. I stopped coming here because of the price and slowness. I paid 55 for acrylic glitter tips. Plus tip. Not worth the money. My other place I go are 40 and 20 for fill. And just as good."
"1","Food still tastes like doo doo.\n\nAnd the service is still on par with the food.\n\nCaveat emptor."
"2","Third floor of the Cosmo. Across from the pool table you'll see a discreet hallway. If you peer through the hallway and see a red pinball machine, you've found yourself some bomb ass pizza.\n\nDon't worry about the toppings, it's not about the toppings here. It's about the crust and the sauce, both of which this little pizzeria knocks out of the park.\n\nThe sauce on this pizza is perfectly seasoned, and there's just the right amount. But the best part is the hand-tossed crust. People usually like thin crust because it's crispy. People usually like pan crust because it's doughy. THIS crust manages to be crispy AND doughy. We figured that one large (10 slices) was enough to feed 5 of us (3 girls, 2 guys), but this pizza was so good that we had to order another large to go.\n\nThe prices here are a bit steep ($4 for a 2-topping slice, $22 for a 3-topping large), but the premium price will definitely get you some premium pie."
"2","My bf and I came here one evening to enjoy the Boom56 gathering and I must say, I really really enjoyed this low key gem!! The spicy cilantro wings BANG!!! Lol...looved them. We sat on the patio and it was cool to people watch all the local neighborhood folk. The DJ played lots of house music which gets me going!! Cant wait to go back in 2 weeks for the next Boom56 set :)"
"2","I really like the decor at this restaurant. Went with some friends for brunch on a weekday, and it wasn't crowded. You can find a table pretty quickly. The waitresses were extremely nice and gave suggestions when we're confused. I ordered the brunch, which had two eggs, sausage, ham, bacon, and your choice of bread. I chose bagel because of its name! Obviously it wasn't St. Viateur or Fairmount, but it was really moist. \n\nThe price is pretty decent for a breakfast place, it comes up to around $10 altogether with coffee/tea. The atmosphere is really quaint and cute. I'll definitely come back again to try out their large selection of omlettes!"
"1","For what they're going for, and what they actually provide, they need to work harder.  It's good... but should be better.\n\nBig black hair in the food... very uncaring service... food was on the lukewarm side.  Sure, what I had was tasty (berry crepe with lemon creme), but everyone else had a very meh to bad meal."
"2","This is another location I have visited many times and every time I received great service and ate great food without fail. The food is cheap and the atmosphere is descent. Bonus points go to the excellent Fried Ice Cream!"
"2","A lot of the reviews here have already given a lot of detail about the airport, so I won't bore you with that -- but I would like to clarify that this airport is MIA (that's Miami) but is LAS. So, there you go. \n\nI like this airport. I've never had a problem with the TSA guys there, the lines have always moved quickly, and the airport is well-signed so you don't get lost. The Starbucks at the pickup area is always full, so they move pretty quickly there, too. \n\nParking has been fixed up a little where you no longer have to insert coinage. Now you get just a printed ticket that you present at the gate to pay. I paid $2.00 for about an hour while I waited for my brother, which seemed reasonable to me. \n\nAll in all, LAS is a cool airport!"
"1","This is an overrated hotel. Is the fountain pretty? Yes. Is the observatory lovely? Yes. Is the Chihuly glass ceiling in the lobby worth a look? Yes. \n\nOther than that, I can think of no other reason to be here. Five minutes in this hotel and my sinuses are stuffed and my eyes are dried out. I can literally feel the cigarette stink sink into my skin and clothing. It's like walking into a gas chamber.\n\nYou'd think for a supposedly upscale hotel, they'd have enough air venting systems in place to combat the throngs of visitors that come through. Ugh... stay away...\n\n(Wow, I think I just became one of those non-smoking snobs...)"
"1","First of all, if you're going to brag about having so many beers from around the world, your staff should be able to recommend something I've never had before. Telling me to try a four peaks beer and pay extra for it doesn't make any sense at all.  The only beers they could tell me about were local. Most people in Tempe that are going to a place called World Of Beer already know about the local beers AZ has to offer. \n\nService seemed really disorganized. Once we sat down, we weren't sure who was around to help us. I felt legitimately ripped off having to pay $16+ for two beers that I could have found anywhere else in a less crowded and better laid-out location.\n\nI have high hopes and I really want this place to redeem itself. But so far, I could care less if I ever go back."
"1","The very first time I went here, it was great. The food was hot, the toppings delicious, and service was very fast. But it's just been slowly going downhill since then over the course of the year. :/ \n\nMy most recent visit, last Sunday in October 2012, the entire staff was unprepared and rude. When my boyfriend ordered his lunch, he was told begrudgingly that they would have to spend 4 to 5  minutes \""cooking\"" his dog. There was no one waiting behind us, so we chose to wait.\n\nFrom snippets of conversation we overhead from the staff, someone either quit that morning or was fired. Apparently it was one of their cooks, because the rest of them didn't seem to know what they were doing. The toppings we got on our dogs were not nearly as plentiful as usual (mine ended up being mostly bun when I started eating it), and the tator tots were stone cold. Not only that, but I was never offered to have them tossed with cinnamon as usual either, and felt like I would be the rude one if I asked... they also tasted like they had just been sitting in the tray for a long time.\n\nOverall the meal was not fulfilling, and at the prices they ask, we will not be going back. So sad, because it started off so well, but it just seems like the owner doesn't really care about the restaurant, as reflected in the staff."
"1","I've been 3 times now becasue its close to home and very comfortable and the food and drinks were really good. So we thought stopping in on Valentines Day would be okay for a quick drink and bite to eat. NOT!  Get there at 5:20ish, only a few couples on the patio (20% capacity).  The hostess stops us and askes if we have a reservation, I responded \""No\"", she then said it would be a few minutes.  Ok.  The place is practically empty, it's been 10 min, a waitress we had the week before says sorry to us and that she's not sure why we can't be seated.  Other couples walk in, no reservations as well and hostess tells them it will be a few minutes.  She then looks at me and says it'll be awhile, what happened to a few minutes?  Did I mention the place is practically empty?  No bar, still being built and can't even get drinks to wait.  I send my boyfriend next door to Pier 54 (which we frequent alot) to look for an empty table, which he calls to tell me he finds.  I then look at hostess to tell her not to bother, we have a table next door adn walk out.  We end up having a lovely evening on the water, live music and Great Service.  Not sure why the Watershed hostess was rude and doesn't know how to organize the timimng of occupants to tables.  She kept saying everything was reserved.  Sitting next door, we watched the onslaught of reservations for the Watershed arrive only for them to not find parking and it was close to 6:30pm.  We could have been in and out in that one hour.  I've had other resurants inform us their busy, but we could have a table if we finished before the next reservation time.  No such thing offered here.  It's back to Pier 54, who is reliable and hires qualified staff."
"2","Loved my meal here (lunch).  Had the chicken terriyaki w/Shrimp Tempura and California roll lunch special.  Food very tasty and service was excellent.  Loved the decor inside the place.  Not your typical Japanese restaurant look.  Would highly recommend.  Other family members dishes were equally as good (my kid loved the Tongkatsu)."
"2","I've come here at least once a week for some time now and have never had a bad experience.  There's a different crowd from night to night to liven things up, but there's is also a decent amount of regulars.  The staff and patrons alike are great people and there's always good times to be had.  Their menu is varied in style and all delicious. definitely a radd place to spend any night of the week at because here's always some sort of special going on."
"1","Worst fine dining experience EVER!!!  Do not come here!  Thomas Keller would be very, very disappointed.\n\n*Note - We were a group of Asians.\n\nWe were in Vegas for a friend's bachelor party.  I suggested Bouchon because I've been there before and enjoyed it.  We had a reservation at 8:45pm on Saturday.  Got there on time to find out that they still needed to prep our table.  Really?  Didn't get seated till 9:10pm.  What's the point of making a reservation? A buddy complained to the manager about the wait.  The manager apologized, saying it was a misunderstanding and gave us a free round of Chimay.  \n\nWe ordered our food and tried to enjoy the rest of the night.  It took 70 MINUTES for them to bring out our food.  Wow!  On top of that, the food wasn't even cook properly.  Bouchon is known to have the best french fries around.  The fries came out overcooked.  The steaks were undercooked and bland.  On the bright side, the moules-frites were pretty good.  No one finished their food.\n\nThe manager came by and tried to offer us free desserts.  We told him we're not trying to get free stuff.  We just want to be respected and treated right.  The waiter was nice, so we ended up giving him a decent tip.  As we were walking out, the manager and waiter were waiting at the door with another free round of Chimay.  He KNEW they were at fault.  We took our beers and walked out, vowing never to come back..."
"1","Ate here the other day.  The food wasn't bad but it wasn't awesome either.  Mediocre at best.  Slightly disappointing based upon the other reviews but I guess we're just spoiled from all of the good taqueria's in Cali.  \n\nWe tried a few different tacos.  Tinga was like soggy pulled pork, Carbon and pollo tacos were okay.  Guacamole was delish but the chips tasted like they were fried in old oil.  I won't be rushing back."
"2","soo, i drove all the way from aliante and the 215 just to get my nails done here. I called to make an appt with no problems.\n\nthen,\ni made myself look like a fool by getting lost and being 10 minutes late. great first impression on my part. pssh! even so, they still took me right in no problems. just fyi, i DO recommend getting there a few minutes early if you scheduled an appt to go through everything they have to offer. especially if you plan on doing any 3d nail art.\n\nanyway,\nI had all three women work on me which made me feel inconvenient. the first lady was not sure how to flare the tips. another ps by the way, if youre looking to get duck tips (flared) make sure theres someone there that can do them. after she said she wasnt able to I was moved to the next lady who did nearly everything else. then the third girl who applied the 3d pieces. everyone was very nice and very professional. they played tangled and smurfs on tv which i loved. im almost 24 in years, but im still 5 at heart. =)\n\nthey have super cute 3d art available.\nincluding rhinestone mickey heads which HELLO, if youve been keeping up with my reviews, i have an obsession with disneyland.\n\nthe price was reasonable as well. to me at least, who averages about 80 bucks on a set. I was only charged $65 total.\n\n$50 for the glitter tips, $5 for the flare, and $5 per 3d piece (one on both ring fingers).\n\ni plan on coming back to this place for sure. every two weeks!"
"2","Pesto Prima is beyond fabulous. I'm local to this spot and so happy I stumbled across this place. It's very quaint and I love that about it. That's the best part about local joints- there's no commercialism involved. Entirely unique. \n\nTheir breakfast sandwiches are literally some of the best I've ever had, and I make sandwiches myself for a living. I visit Pesto Prima several times a week and I ALWAYS get a Java Mocha Blast: iced coffee, banana, protein powder, peanut butter, chocolate, Nutella- all blended into a smooth creamy breakfast concoction. SO FREAKING GOOD. I often just get this and it sustains me until I eat lunch later. I used to be a big D'lish fan, which is not far from here and also local, but they have nothing on Prima. Prima's portions are extremely generous for a really decent price. Staff and owner are super duper friendly and we always have a good convo. Kayla is great! If you're in the area, go here. You won't be disappointed!"
"1","Many unusual items, including menudo and Italian wedding soup, were offered in addition to standard breakfast fare.  I stuck with traditional by filling my plate with fresh fruit and yogurt, an Eggbeaters' spinach omelet with mozzarella, bacon and ambrosia.  Everything was fresh and more than adequate."
"2","A fantastic dinner.  The spicy noodles with shrimp was simply excellent.  The shrimp itself was especially tasty.\n\nFirst class service.\n\nA great restaurant tucked into a strip mall."
"2","Sightseeing location #2: Bellagio Hotel & Conservatory of Flowers\n\n+: fancy flower arrangements upon entering; nice displays everywhere worthy of a second look; good layout so not easy to get lost; beautiful fountain shows every 15 minutes\n-: some security guard who yelled at the pedestrians for unable to leave the hotel entrance during NYE b/c the streets were packed with people. \n\nThe whole experience at Bellagio was surreal b/c the hotel was absolutely gorgeous! If not for the run-in with that rude man who was shoving everyone out, it would have been an amazing experience."
"1","We made a stop here after seeing \""Shutter Island\"".  Great movie, not a great experience here.  When we walked in and sat at a table in the bar we were promptly greeted by the bartender and placed our order.  She returned quickly with our pitcher of beer ($8.00).  The music was playing and the atmosphere was nice.  Not to loud to talk and sports on the big screen.  I figured this might be a nice place to hang out.  \n\nWell, it went down hill from there.  My lovely wife decided that we should split a sampler platter so we did.  Our food came out within about 10 minutes.  The \""platter\"" was a small basket containing the following: 3 onion rings, 3 mozzarella sticks, 3 potato skins and 3 stuffed peppers.  The quality was on the order of the freezer section at frys......    The price on this was $11.99!   Now, I could be a little more understanding if it was $5.99.....\n\nSo....   We ate and worked on drinking our pitcher as it started to rain.  I then made a visit to the bathroom which was filthy and without paper towels.   I returned to my seat in the bar and watched the platinum blond, that appears to be known by most of the customers, as she tried to find someone that might be willing to take her home for the night.  \n\nI guess my opinion would be that this place is not worth a return visit.  \n\nI am certain that we can find a better place to spend our money in the future!"
"1","I've had a ton of shabu shabu being from socal. This just wasn't good. The ingredients were not as tasty and fresh as I wanted."
"1","If I could give a zero star I would.\n\nI have NEVER been so discriminated in my life at any business until I went here. I went with a group of friends to check out their nightclub and upon entrance the bouncer pulled me aside asked me my name where I lived then ACCUSED me of being on drugs cause my eyes were big. I have natural big eyes. Next he ACCUSED me of being too fucked up and I can never enter the club again. I was sober and told him to breathalyze me or do a drug test and I'll test negative. He refused and just kicked me out. He said I was walking weird, I'm pidgeon toed! He was then mocking me with my big eyes by opening his eyes wide and talking really slowly like as if I'm stupid. \n\nI have never ever felt so discriminated. Hakkasan ruined my experience and I am NEVER coming back here. If you're in vegas looking for a club to enter please go to Marquee or XS. This club needs to enforce better bouncers."
"1","I have never tasted something and had an immediate association with a movie until tonight.  The second the water hit my tongue I thought of Shawshank Redemption and knew that the river of shit that Tim Robbins swam through is the same water which was currently in the glass on my table. \n\nJust as concerning as the taste of sewer was the waitress's reaction when I told her that something tasted very wrong with the water and asked for a diet coke: she had none.  She didn't make any comment or ask me any question.  She said, sure, I can bring you a diet coke.  When she returned with the diet coke I inquired if anything in my glass from the pop to the ice cubes to the glass had at any point shared anything that could have been in my water.  She said no, almost cheerily.  To her credit she was like 17 and thinking of what she is going to wear to her prom, but WTF.\n\nThe ahi tuna was dry as shit and tasted as though I was eating something that had an adhesive layer I was meant to remove.  I actually tried to remove part of it.  No adhesive. Sadly.\n\nThis place is on my mother's \""fabulous happy hours\"" list.  I never had any faith in this list, but as I was just visiting in the past I played along,  as she thinks that any place that has any kind of happy hour is fabulous.  Now that I am going to live here, no more."
"1","This review pertains to the main Clark County Library Branch (on East Flamingo Road). It does not touch on the theater, events, or library district.  \n\n  This Main Library Branch falls short of my expectations for a respectable main library branch. And secondary library branch for that matter. \n\n   These days the Main Library Branch appears more like a mental hospital annex than a library. Inside and outside the library, homeless people loiter to the point that some are using it as a Motel 6. The drug and alcohol epidemic is the constant exhibit. The restrooms are repulsive. The incapable security guards are totally dysfunctional. For example, earlier, a mentally ill man was raging at a librarian for waking him up. I am appalled at how slow the security guard handled the disturbance. Ineffective security also creates an intimidating environment to walk outside the building. Libraries, especially the main branch are supposed to be symbols of civic pride; this one is a symbol of the effects of drug use and alcoholism.\n\n  Comparable to some of  the Clark County Library branches, the Main Branch instock is the very image of a Border's \""Going Out of Business Sale\"". On account of a new Clark County Library policy, patrons are allowed endless renewals. The consequence is that some of the library patrons bookshelf collection is growing while the library' s collection is becoming bare.\n\n  Comparable to all the Clark County Library branches, the hours of operation are absurd, yet better than the Henderson Library District. It is unacceptable to close at 7 P.M. weekdays and 5 P.M. on weekends. Especially when a large percentage of patrons leave work after 4 P.M.\n\n  In my most honest opinion, the Main Branch fails to inspire people to develop a reading habit. It will most likely inspire people not to abuse drugs or alcohol."
"1","Had their advertised thanksgiving dinner for $65.00.  Was not worth a penny of it.  The taste of the turkey was very bland.  The mini squash the soup was served in should have been baked first then served with the soup.  The quantity was not adequate as I left still hungry. Showed up for the 4:30 dinner seating and the gal at the front said they were sold out until 8:30pm, so she said I could sit out on the bar and have my dinner. However, after completing my dinner at 5;30pm, I strolled into the dining room and the place was empty.  Maybe I wasn't dressed enough for them.  i felt not wanted and therefore, would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. Bad service all around."
"1","sriracha and Tabasco are your only hopes at hippies\n\n--Bland, greasy and undercooked potato dice\n--coffee quality (like everything else here) is piss-poor\n--pancakes from a box, agave syrup doesn't do much\n--plastic plates and utensils ruin whatever's left, like a fly-infested bowl of potato mush at the neighborhood pot luck, now scooped to mouth with a flimsy twist of soft sporkage. \n--regular commercial radio accompanies...with commercials\n\nMISS IT"
"2","Great place to eat in the arrowhead area. What I like to do is go there before hitting Harkins Arrowhead Fountains and get the Tortilla Soup and Chicken Tacos. It's like around $9 and fills you up. Busy enough where you can tell that it's good but isn't overly packed. Most I've ever waited was 45 minutes and that was during spring training on a saturday night."
"2","Wow, purely by accident, my kids and I stumbled upon this tiny place facing the waterfront. SO glad we did!\n\nI have extolled the crepes from Montreal for months prior to visiting, so I was quietly praying that the crepes here wouldn't disappoint. And they didn't. Whew! We ordered two meal crepes and one dessert crepe. All were fantastic: light, airy, filled just right, with excellent ingredients, with a bit of wonderful maple syrup to drizzle on top. Truly the best crepes ever. We were too full afterwards for the much-touted maple ice cream, but my kids made me promise to return for some later on in the week.\n\nOther notes: we sat outside, which afforded us a fantastic place to people-watch and admire the waterfront and the passing caleches. Only problem: it was a sunny and hot day, with no umbrellas to shield us from the sun (as the other adjacent bistros and cafes had). One big plus, though: nice bathroom inside to use if needed. Plus, the gals that work here could NOT be nicer! We will definitely be back."
"2","I found my happy place."
"2","Noda Brewery is an awesome place to stop by for an evening round of beers or a weekend day drinking session. They are dog friendly which is cool for those with well-behaved dogs. They do not serve food but typically have a local food truck outside serving eats. It is right next to Birdsong for those who want to hop back and forth. Pricing is very reasonable including for the flight for those undecided or looking to try something new. I love the What Gose Around. The tour is cool if you are there for it you should check it out. One of my favorite spots!"
"1","Awful! My husband and I came out to mesa to go to a concert at the Nile and figured we would get out there a little bit early to eat something before the show. We sat outside and the boy that sat us gave us some chips and salsa..which was okay. What was not okay is that we sat around for 15 minutes without someone in the staff even glancing an eye at us..even bringing us water would have been great.\n\nAfter my patience ran out I looked around and noticed another very unhappy couple asking for the manager and complained about the food. After that we decided we have had enough and simply walked out. The next time I come out to the Nile for a show I will be sure to eat somewhere before we get out to mesa."
"1","Gordon I love you, I really do. But this place was awful! Let's start with the server. She was extremely rude, didn't explain anything when we asked and when I ordered something she snapped that it would not be enough food. So rude. That was about the last time we saw her all night because her twin sister was dining there and pretty much every second she was at that table talking to her instead of serving anyone. I am not exaggerating, she didn't come back to actually talk to us until giving us the bill. The only saving grace was the awesome bus girl who was very sweet and attentive. \nThe food. I was expecting so much for the price and because it's Gordon's place! \nThe chicken sliders: soooo dry! Really tough meat (which is odd for chicken) and zero flavor) \nThe french fries: way overcooked, cold and chewy \nThe classic burger: nothing special at all \n\n\nTo say I was disappointed was an understatement. \nMaybe I need to hang out with my waitresses twin sister to actually get any service."
"1","I am consistently underwhelmed when I go there. Quite honestly the only reason why I dined at McAlisters today was because I was invited. Otherwise I would have chosen another lunch spot. The service is good, The food comes out fast but the quality of food is lacking and the decor is insulting. Think Scottish kilt meets a cafeteria in an Irish Pub. Plaid, Formica, plastic plants and antique nick knacks run amuck. \n\nToday my Cobb Salad was all lettuce with small amounts of chicken and blue cheese that were hanging out with yesterdays tomato's. Are you excited by that? I didn't think so.\n\nI will say one person at my table had the 1/2 French Dip and a Loaded Baked Potato and he said it was great. If I ever make it back over there maybe I will give it a try."
"2","The sweetest staff who are completely professional and really take the time to make your nails perfect.  Shout out to Peter you are amazing!!"
"2","They really make travel easy.  Not only is it cheaper to park at Pre-Flight than to park at the airport, it is also more convenient.  When you arrive, they give you a section to park in.  Within a matter of minutes a van picks you up from you car and a friendly drive loads your luggage into the van.  When you arrive at the airport, the same friendly driver take care of your bags again.  Upon returning, you go to the designated curb and a van is never more than 10 minutes away.  They take you right to your car and will even load your luggage into your trunk.\n\nExcellent service!"
"1","Two stars for quality of food. Bf and I wanted a special dinner on our night in Vegas, but we didn't even get to the main course! We ordered the lobster mac and cheese, foie gras, and truffle onion soup which were all highly rated. I've never turned down mac and cheese, but this was something else! It was watery like they just boiled the noodles and rushed it out before draining the hot water. Truffle onion soup was tasty and well presented, so we thought the noodles were just a fluke. Foie Gras wasn't a taste we've acquired yet, so I want to be fair, it's probably good for those who like it. On to drinks: we ordered the trio sampler... let's just say it brought us back to the days when frat boys were passing out shots to the freshman girls. Poor quality booze, SLOW Service and just bad mac and cheese... how can you mess up mac and cheese?! So we left without ordering any further and looked for a different restaurant for dinner =("
"2","I loved my food here! Please see pics of my appetizer and dessert.\nThe service was wonderful from beginning to end. I had salmon wrapped pear as an appetizer. It was sprinkled with olive oil. Very fresh, light and refreshing!\nTo drink...a lychee martini. It was good\nFor my main course, I ordered the black cod with miso sauce. It was scrumptious! It was flaky and flavorful. I would order this again.\nI just couldn't go to a Japanese restaurant and not get sushi...so I order yellowtail with jalape\u00f1o. It was the right amount of spicy.\nDessert...flourless chocolate cake...side of house made green tea ice cream garnished with blueberries and raspberries. Phenomenal!\nMy only complaint is that it was extremely pricey. But I would still return!"
"2","After being dropped off in the South Side and striking out at a couple of other bars, we finally found our spot for the night at Lava Lounge. What can I say, this place is just downright awesome. There was no cover, the drinks were cheap, the music was loud, and I mean come on, the place looks like a cave. How cool is that?\n\nThat being said, it can be a pretty confusing place inside once you have a few drinks in you, especially if you have never been there before. They keep it pretty dark and for me at least, it got a bit disorientating. Then again, I had been drinking, so who knows how much that came into play. \n\nAll in all, Lava Lounge was a shining light in an area overrun by bro bars, and if I ever find myself in Pittsburgh again, I will be sure to make a trip to the South Side and visit this Fraggle Rock-esque bar again. Dance you cares away! Worries for another day!.."
"1","Not only they have bad customer service over the phone..they employees aren't any better...I was helped by a male employe (whose name I don't remember) who treated me as if I was a leper or had a contagious disease. The flotation bath was OK, I can relax in my own bathtub with hot water and Epsom salts ( in the comfort of my own home) and with all the towels I  need. I may not float but I won't be spending a wad of money. I found really crappy that they give you just one towel and nothing to put on the floor after the bath..the floor gets very slippery because the feet are wet with the gooey water...so after the relaxation you may end up falling flat on your tush or even worse, breaking a bone..and in the dark, since the light switch is away from the cabin and cannot be seen...Will I come back to have another \""amazing experience\"" at this spa?......you can guess my answer...."
"2","Loved this placed. Heck I come here twice a week and to get away from my roomie, that plays the same song \""Da Butt\"" by E.U a good ten times back to back everyday. It's new, up to date, and quiet(which is what I love when I am studying)."
"2","If you are looking for a great place to go in Tempe to sit, relax and have a great time with friends or make new ones at the bar you have arrived.\n\nCasey's is the local pub of Tempe and has held that crown for decades.  It is where you find an eclectic crowd who are all just there to enjoy themselves.  It is where 60 something's mingle with 20 something's who have become grown up drinkers and have tired of the Mill Ave seen.\n\nThe old \""craftsman style\"" house converted into a restaurant and bar are inviting, and the bartenders do remember your name. Not to be out outdone; the enormous patio is perfect for spending your afternoon day drinking and enjoying oysters on the half shell.\n\nThis would also be my choice for where to start and sometimes end your St. Patrick's Day celebration! Get there early and claim your spot because this place gets crowded early.\n\nSo if you are looking for a really chill place to just hang out and be merry with your friends Casey Moore's is hard to beat.\n\nA couple final notes: Yes you can pee on the Blarney Stone and Yes Casey Moore's is haunted.\n\nEnjoy!"
"1","I couldnt agree more with Steve N. This place is pretty horrible. It's like, they bought dim sum from CA, brought it over, froze it and now reheating to serve to us. It's hard, tastless and definitely mehhhhhh. \n\nI quote Steve N. \"" more like dimshit\"""
"2","This place is a keeper! Went early on a Saturday evening. The front bar was full, but not crowded. However, the deck was fully packed! I had two organic margaritas and an order of the Pescado(fish) tacos. The tacos were good (a little bland for my taste), and the drinks were strong! \n\nThe music they played that night was amazing, 90s rap and R&B. I don't know if people dance there, but I was ready to bust a move! The women's bathroom is set up awkwardly... You enter into a very small room with one sink, then you enter into another small room with one toilet... I hope you're not claustrophobic! \n\nAll in all it was a good time!"
"2","I was impressed with this place. The wait was not very long even though it looked like every table was completely packed.\n\nWe decided to hit the bar for a few beers. I forgot what i was drinking but it was a nice big Italian beer for $8...not bad prices for Las Vegas. Just as we took our first sip of beer our table was ready.  Sometimes I think restaurants want you to order a drink at the bar even though your table might be ready...it is a smart business move but as a consumer I find it tacky...oh well!\n\nWe were given a great table in the fake outside. These restaurants crack me up with all of the fake elements. I feel like I'm eating on the set of a movie every minute. When are they going to make fake birds come over and try to eat my real bread? At least I hope it's real...the bread I mean!\n\nI made a special request from the waiter. I wanted my pasta cooked in a fresh pot of water with no salt. He said no problem. Some girl in our party...I don't even know who she was but she started giving me a hard time. Telling me the rest of the table was going to have to wait for there food because of me. She also started saying other things but I tuned her out. I didn't know she worked for the restaurant. Oh wait she doesn't! Just completely annoying! I'm still wondering who invited her? I would give her 1 star if I could review her!\n\nHere is the funny part. All of our pasta hit the table and someone at the table said, \""can we get grated cheese?\"". The food runner then said, \""I would recommend you try the pasta first because our water we cook the pasta in is really salty and people always complain it is too salty!\"" I looked right at this girl and said,\""Wow that's ironic the food runner would say that!!!\"". I then looked at the food runner and said,\""Load me up on the cheese because I had my pasta cooked in unsalted water!\"". I then shot a dirty look at this girl sitting at our table. She knew I directed it at her but she had no come back at me! I've never met someone who would attack someone at there own table for a special request!!! I hope she liked her salty pasta dish!\n\nI had the pasta with the shrimp and it was really good. Guess what? It wasn't salty at all. In fact, others at the table commented at how smart I was for requesting fresh unsalted water!  Sometimes it is good to ask and I was so happy with this restaurant honoring my special request.  A slammed restaurant that still cares about making there customer happy.  I love it!!!\n\nWe also started with a pizza too and it was really good! I was really surprised at how tasty everything we ordered. I would come back here for dinner and drinks but I will not be dinning with that mean girl ever again. I am so glad I have no idea who she is and hopefully I'll never see her again. You gotta love Vegas!!!"
"2","Huge fan of this place, huge! I eat here at least twice a week, it's that good!\n\nThey have a huge selection of salad items and they're always fresh and available. The toppings are just awesome if you love vegetables!\n\nIt's always clean, and sometimes there are lines, but they go fast and I've rarely ever had to wait for a table. Everyone is super nice and accommodating here. \n\nI think the only thing that bugs me is that it is a little high for the salad and soup that I get. Lunch is around $12 and dinner is around $15 even though you get the same things. Not sure what the price difference is for.\n\nThey always have a selection of baked potatoes and toppings, lots of muffins; from corn, to blueberry to lemon although the selection can vary. They also have mac 'n cheese and pasta, but I skip that - it's way too fattening for me. They have a large selection of both regular, vegetarian and vegan soups that are all delicious. They also have a dessert bar, but I've never used it. \n\nThis is my go-to healthy place when I want  a big salad after working out. It never fails me!"
"1","I don't think our kids notice the age of the hotel or the cramped environment around the pool, but I do. Having stayed at Holiday Inn Vacations Orange Lake Resort in Orlando this Hilton Point Phoenix property is disappointing. \n\nThe water was murky and the lazy river had people drinking excessively floating around. Not the best environment if you have kids. If you are looking for a drinking party environment and murky water, this could be the place for you. \n\nPlenty of security in the parking lot, but no life guards anywhere. Mini golf was run down. Tennis courts and basketball looked fine. \n\nRestaurant by the pool had okay food. Nothing worth recommending. Again, kids seemed to like burgers."
"2","Nom nom!  So good!  If you want something different when it comes to Mexican food think of this place as gourmet, upscale Mexican cuisine.  It's absolutely fabulous and everything is fresh, fresh, fresh!  Fun, modern, eclectic decor allows for a relaxed evening or a fun night out with friends.  Great stocked bar with one of the best margaritas I've had in Vegas so far. \n\nHowever, my only complaint is that when we first went here we came with big group of people and I had made reservations ahead of time.  We stayed a long time, ordered bottles of wine and lots of food.  But for some reason our server was very confused and somewhat irritated when we said we wanted to split the check amongst the couples.  He huffed and puffed about it being difficult to split the check etc. but in the end did it for us even after we marked the bill accordingly with each couples' items. \n\nI'm sorry, I used to be a server and 1) it's not hard to split a check with the automated system that I saw this restaurant had and 2) you should pretty much assume that one person in a large group of people is not going to pick up the whole bill.  It would have been nice if our server had hashed the particulars with us ahead of time before we all had a wonderful evening and then had to deal with bill drama.  Perhaps if you go here with a lot of friends tell the server up front you will be splitting the check accordingly.\n\nOtherwise, I would highly recommend Mundo as an off-Strip but tasty find."
"2","After dropping by Zoe's a few more times, I think it's completely fair to award them additional star. Why? Let me 'splain...\n\n1) Super fast, super fresh and delicious. This goes especially for their Turkey Stack - a grilled sandwich filled with turkey breast, mozzarella, feta spread, lettuce, tomato, sourdough and rosemary oil. Get yourself a Turkey Stack.\n\n2) The employees are really, really sweet. Forgot your fork? No worries, they'll snag one for you while you start on your sammich. \n\n3) Nice outdoor seating. People watching can be enjoyable at the Met - trust me. \n\n4) Their desserts magnanimous. I haven't indulged in one yet but the cookies and brownies look ah-mazing. \n\nDefinitely on my short list for a tasty lunch when I'm zooming around the Met."
"2","Has got to be one of my favorite restaurants. Monday and Tuesday when you are there at or after 8-close, It is $20 bucks for a bottle of wine and your choice of four different slices of their bruschetta. \n\nThe Chicken and Mozzarella Panini is one of my favorites.\n\nYou can easily have a dinner for two, including an app, two entree's and a bottle of wine for well under $60.\n\nBe aware that there WILL be about an hour wait for this quaint little restaurant. However, in the same center is a place called La Grande Orange that you can grab a decent bottle of wine at while waiting for your table. As well when you do that they validate your valet parking ($3) not including a tip. \n\nValet is a must usually around this spot since the parking is quite horrible. But when you expect it, you should not be disappointed."
"2","Wow! Very impressed! \n\nThe BBQ is very good with a nice smoke flavor. The rub is perfect, not too salty or spicy. The sauce was both sweet and savory. This is very good BBQ. The macaroni and cheese was a little greasy but very good. \n\nWhat stood out to me was the banana pudding. I wasn't expecting it to be really good but I was pleasantly surprised! It was very sweet and had a good texture. \n\nSide note: Kool-aid is a drink that you can buy on the menu. I don't know if this is everywhere or just in Vegas but I chuckled when I saw it on the menu!"
"2","Delicious Asian food but was not impressed by the sushi. The sushi was warm rather than cold like I like it. We've gone here twice waiters work their booties off and give great service. A great place to go as a group the family meal had excellent value."
"1","Very disappointing. Boring, unoriginal, faux Italian food. Seems to me the chef enjoys using that fryalotor instead of grilling or sauteing... which take skill, of course. My companion's side of chicken was not grilled, but deep fried. Which is odd, because the chicken on my caramelized pear salad was obviously boiled.  Another guest's fried zucchini was heavily coated with breadcrumbs, heavy & barely edible. \n\nIt's a great location, good atmosphere, but I will definitely not be returning. Service was mediocre."
"2","Haven't been here in a loooooong time, mostly because, you know, the fried food thing...not that they only fry all their food, only the good stuff like fried shrimp, fried coconut shrimp, french fries, fried crab cakes, fried beer...yeah pretty much that. \n\nThis was the first time sampling one of the 'pots' and I was impressed. Plenty of steamed and seasoned goodness of crab, corn, shrimp, potatoes and andouille sausage. \n\nService was good despite, and I'm not kidding, an unexpected group of over 100 in the same room. \nGood times and good food. Cheers"
"1","This is another example of buying product hype and a service that is not ready for primetime. \n\nWhen it works, it's great, when it doesn't, which is often, customer service is clueless. They go by a manual but clearly don't know what the purpose is for certain procedures.\n\nThen, when nothing else works, you get transferred (maybe) to a \""Level 2 tech.\"" Oh boy! \n\nWhat they've usually said, after a lot of useless attempts from the livel 1 tech, is, \""Oh, they're down for maintenance.\"" This was said once in the middle of the day. I asked if they meant routine maintenance, she said she thought so. \n\nThere's a great time to do it. During business hours, if that was correct.\n\nWhen it wasn't working for the 3rd day in a row, I was told they would need 7-10 days to investigate. Then, this morning, it was working again. But, it wouldn't connect with Gmail. Everything else worked but that. The level 1 tech suggested I disconnect the modem and/or router, reboot, etc. Now nothing works. I called back and they said the system is out in this area. He said it would be back online within an hour. That was 3 hours ago!\n\nBeware, buy only when all the beta kinks are out."
"2","My sister mentioned this cupcake place she saw on the Food Network and how they had gained national acclaim for winning the \""cupcake wars\"" so I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. Turns out this place is right down the street from my job so I peeked my head in the door on my break to enter a nice little quaint bakery. Between the registers they have it sort of split up into two sections, the everyday flavors (chocolate,vanilla,red velet, carrot cake) and more towards the front where you walk in are the specialty flavors for the day. Only way the know before hand what they will be is to become a fan on their facebook page which I found to neat way to market themselves and keep fans of the store checking in with them on a regular basis. I've tried many of the flavors and for the most part have enjoyed them all (the sweet tea one was sort of bleh, the raspberry vanilla cr\u00e8me may top my list) They all are super sweet, very rich, fresh with creamy frosting on top. Maybe a tad bit pricey for a cupcake (2.75 per cupcake) but you can't deny the quality. Even though they are just regular sized cupcakes, I can barely finish one or two being so super duper sweet (and I have a pretty good size sweet tooth so that's saying something) It can get busy in a heartbeat over there with the increase demand and a small staff but don't be discouraged if you see a line as they do a decent job of getting to everyone in & out. All in all, if you're in the mood for a tasty desert, give this place a try you'll be in for a real treat!"
"1","Had red curry chicken, the chicken itself was awesome but the reason they only get 3 stars is their rice.   Enough curry chicken for 2-3 servings, enough rice for a starving karate kid. Like seriously less than a cup of cooked rice. I asked for more rice to finish my meal and they charge me 2 dollars more for another scoop of white rice. I cook jasmine rice at home and for the 6 cents it costs to make that much rice, its really upsetting when they nickel and dime you.   You guys lost a customer for the cheapest thing you make ...,"
"2","Unbelievable sandwiches! Tried their world famous Bobbie & Capistrami subs and both were outstanding! Heard a rumor that they're opening a location in San Diego in the very near future... Give this place a try if you're not yet familiar with the Capriotti sandwich shops, they're the BEST!"
"2","More like 3.5 stars but id rather give an extra .5 for a locally owned place than take it away. \n\nHubby & i have been coming here for years. Its a dive for sure, with kitchy 50s decor that looks like it may have been here since the 50s, but i like that sort of thing. They even have a jukebox playing oldies :)\n\nThe service is usually friendly, the food is ok but nothing to write home about. Its decent though, fills your belly, and is relatively cheap. \n\nKids meals are only $2.65 each, and theyll give you coloring pages if you ask. Its a very casual atmosphere that makes me & my gang of kids feel welcome. \n\nBigger portions, Lots of choices & they accomodate substitutions with no problem. Try the homemade pumpkin nut bread, also the homemade \""chips\"". \n\nTheres a reason we come here several times a month. Maybe a 4 stars after all :)"
"1","If budget is your only concern than by all means stay here, but if you could spare an extra $10 a night, stay somewhere else! You have been forewarned!  Place is run down and still under contruction.  I saw dudes working on every floor doing various minor cosmetic and some major cosmetic repairs!  Made me weary.  but I should have known from the start what I was in for just from their tiny a$$ parking lot!  then their old and very unstable elevator ( felt like ppl were shaking it).  The rooms/hotel had a stale smell.\ndo not stay unless u on a tight budget!! I know repeated! =)  but have fun!"
"2","I decided to walk a little around the strip mall after an extremely awesome omakase dinner at the new Kabuto restaurant, debating if I should get ramen at their sister restaurant Monta. Before I could make up my mind, plus I was distracted from yet another Sprint dropped call, I saw the well lit Volcano Tea House.  So like a moth drawn to the cool blue electric insect imploding devices at modern camp sites, I decided to drop in for some more sweets and a side order of free radicals for my body to fight off.\n\nThe interior is not big, but it is simply decorated with bright cheery smiley face yellow-ish color scheme. They have an easy menu to order from in the back corner of the store.  A 20/40 or better vision is helpful for accomplishing that visual accuity test, or you can just look down at the menu taped down on the counter.  And while I was still talking to a friend about my recent dining experience, the taro milk tea san boba that I ordered was already prepared and waiting for me.  Heck, it was ready before I even recieved my change. Yes, that fast!\n\nThe taro milk tea was good.  And if you are a regular, you might as well get their stamp card, that you can parlay into a free beverage after paying for 10.  You don't even have to be cool like me, or show off your nearly perfected used car purchasing negotiation skills.  Yeah, the folks at Volcano Tea House are equally nice to everyone that pays for their assortment of Asian beverage offerings. A verbal \""thank you\"" or \""xie xie\"" (sounds like shieh shieh) is still appreciated, plus it shows you have some manners. \n\nIs this place good for groups?  Only if the group is not too big or your friends like standing.  There are only a few tables, and not too many chairs, so it is more suited for the order and go crowd.  However, while I was there, I did see a group of Chinese girls playing some card game, and another group of guys chillaxing at another table. \n\nIf this volcano is in the same family tree as the other Volcano Tea Houses in Cali, then this is by far the smallest.  But the drinks, at least the ones I typically order tastes pretty much the same.\n\nParking:  There is almost not enough to share between all the businesses in this tiny strip mall with a handful of really popular dining destinations.  You definitely should carpool, as it is not only good for your wallet, the environment, but for me!\n\nP.S.  Even before I drove out of the parking lot to go write this review, the owner already requested to be my Yelp friend. See the pattern? They really like doing things F-A-S-T!"
"1","If you've ever eaten good Mexican food in your life you would know this place is NOT the spot. I have no idea how it's the highest rated option on yelp.\n\n1 burrito, 2 tacos, & a drink costs $19.73. That's already a no. Then you're like... okay it's Vegas, of course it'll cost a little more, whatever. 5 minutes later, you get your food and it tastes like nothing. Nothing.\n\nI'm from LA so I have decent expectations for Mexican food and this was almost disrespectful. No flavor and the meat was cold. The watermelon drink was good.\n\nBottom line: this place is one very small step above Taco Bell. If you're from LA or SD, any taco truck you might go to is better than this."
"2","Great service. Cool atmosphere. Trying the Sage chicken as featured on Man vs. food. Highly recommended by the staff."
"1","Yeah...so for some reason, I'm writing about Red Lobster.  I mean I guess I did eat there yesterday but it really almost seems like a waste of effort.\n\nA while ago (like 20 years) I liked Red Lobster a lot.  Use to go to the one in Torrance Cali by Del Amo mall pretty regularly and it was halfway decent.  But somewhere along the way it kind of went off the rails.\n\nPrior to last night the last 2 times I ate at a Red Lobster was in Bismarck and Grand Forks ND...at that's about 7 years ago.  After those experiences I swore the place off.\n\nSo back to last night.  It was Lobsterfest time so we ordered two lobster based meals.  Not bad.  The melted \""butter\"" stuff was waaayyyy salty.  But other than that things weren't bad.\n\nThe service...nice guy but waaaaaaayyyyyyy tooooooooo slooooooooowwwwww.  Asking for tabsco sauce after the meal came took waaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyy tooooooooo loooooooonnnnnnnggggggg.  Getting a refill on a soda took waaaaaaayyyyyyy tooooooo loooooooonnnnnnngggggg.\n\nWith a bottle of wine, a $10 off coupon and tip, bill came to $100 for two.  Whaaaaaatttttttt!!!!!?????  For not much more money I can get a far better seafood meal, at a far nicer restaurant (a few places in the Scottsdale Quarter come to mind).\n\nIt might be another 7 years before I return."
"1","Someone please help this location... The staff is undertrained,they are out of key items and supplies  and they cannot keep up with the demands of a busy  location. Fortunately they are nice which eases the annoyances of long waits and other issues."
"1","Come here every other day or so. My wife and I get trenta black tea lemonades. I know some people think that they are good at their jobs, and don't have to follow procedures on some things, but if u don't do it the right way, it doesn't turn out good. I have never had my drink taste the same from this place. The tea, lemonade, and sweetener need to be measured! If they aren't, then u receive drinks that taste like crap. Measure, add ice, and SHAKE! Don't be lazy. Make the items the way they should be."
"1","Wow. I honestly cannot relate to the good reviews.  We love ethnic foods and had been looking forward to Abay especially after reading the reviews on Yelp.  We were the first customers to arrive for dinner on a Saturday evening and ordered the combination platter with four different meat dishes.  When the food arrived, all dishes (including the rice) were lukewarm and watery which leads me to believe that nothing was freshly prepared and the food came either out of the fridge or was frozen and not sufficiently heated up before it was served to us.  As to the flavor of the food, it was hot, i.e. spicy (which we like), but once you got beyond the spiciness, the flavor was bland and all four sauces tasted pretty much the same.  In addition to the the substandard quality of the food, the service was the last straw.  We each received one fork and had to specifically request spoons so we could get the rice and meat dishes out of the bowls and onto our plates. I guess they were short on utensils since following this request, we were only given 2 spoons.   There were 7 waitresses in the dining room (all in their early 20s) who were very busy conversing with each other the whole time we were there (the place was only half full) and once we had finished eating, we sat at the table for about 20 minutes waiting for the plates/dishes to be removed and to find out what the dessert menu looks like. Nobody bothered to come to the table and we had to walk up to the chatting girls and request the check (by that time we had decided to skip the dessert and never return).\n\n9/13/10 addition to above review made 9/12/10:  the owner of the restaurant contacted me within 12 hours of having posted my review and apologized for our less than perfect dining experience and the lack of service.  It is nice to see that Abay's management takes reviews seriously and aims to make every guest's dining experience a postitive experience.  We'll write this one off to \""everybody can have a bad day every once in a while\"" and will give Abay another try."
"1","We are RCI owners and didn't trade for this but paid $199 for the week on special. Here are my issues as a owner who frequently trades with Diamond. Please note I left these issues with management and NEVER heard back despite their \""strive for 5\"" policy posted:\n\nThey charge for an in-room safe. As an owner this is a liability and serious concern.\n\nThey charge for the shuttle. Other properties  do not.\n\nUnclear and random pool closures which felt like we were being herded due to presentations.\n\nPowdered creamer in the coffee bar area cheapens the resort. Other RCI resorts offer coffee all day with REAL creamer. \n\nThe use of in-room jacuzzis is loud and prevalent. Beware of all hour usage. As a mom of two kids - I was passed out asleep as was my husband and we opted to play cards for the entire hour of usage above us.\n\nThere is no DVD player in the bedrooms. When traveling with others it's a nice separation from the living area. Be warned if you are parents. \n\nThe game room is dated with archaic \""prizes\"". It's actually embarrassing and needs attention. Prizes for \""mp3 player\"" and foam headphones from 2000 are available and may be relics now.\n\nThere are NO activities or activities staff at this resort. Having made friends with our group of Sunday-Sunday folks they all voiced the same concern.\n\nShould you choose to utilize the unadvertised putting green in attempt to amuse children- they require and ID rather than a room hold. I argued this point again to no avail- I'm not giving anyone my CA ID for freaking mini golf clubs.\n\n\nSouth Point Casino offers a variety of activities that this resort fails to mentions. There are food deals, bowling, we even visited a free rodeo- I think neighbors should do a better job of dual promotion. \n\nHowever room is clean and staff is friendly. These are management issues and I repeat were not addressed during my stay although they advertise a \""please tell us policy\"".  BE WARNED."
"1","Extremely disappointed in this place. To begin with, my margarita was made with only tequila and agave nectar and did not taste very great. \n\nWe waited for 30 minutes to get a drink order. We never got the crayons I requested for my kiddos to entertain them while we waiting so long. \n\nThe waiters take their orders from their iPhones which seem a little unprofessional. My husband requested a dozen crabs to share with my son and the waiter recommended only getting one crab per person. We waited an hour to receive our food. I ordered two appetizers and I was pleased with my food but my husband and my son were starving after finishing their one crab. We had to go get something to eat afterward. \n\nNeedless to say we were very disappointed with our visit and will not be returning."
"2","I come here 4 days a week. Great staff. Not really much you can say about a coffee shop. Prices are reasonable and they have a punch card (10 drinks, get one for $1). I think that is kind of dumb though. I buy 10 drinks at approximately $4 then I am spending $40. Why can't I get a free drink? You're really going to charge me a buck? Regardless, I keep coming back. My one MAJOR complaint is their internet really stinks. Some days it barely works. Sadly, that is why I will go there when I don't need my internet and will visit their competitor down the street (Xtreme Bean) when I need to use my computer. If they had solid internet I would probably live there and it would definitely be 5 stars! \n\nP.S. Sometimes you can catch the Subway connection from next door and it is better!"
"1","our waiter was very nice and patient. there were 4 of us and being first timers, had lots of questions. \n\nthe burgers were good but they werent great. we ordered medium rare but came over cooked. we all prefer some of the other burger places in town. \nsweet potato fries were disappointing as I read a yelp review recommending them... the onion rings were good but again, not great. fried calamari was okay. Brussel sprouts were good but you better like spicy or dont waist your time. \nunfortunately, we won't be coming back."
"1","This place blows...there's not much else I could say to dress up this review.  If you're expecting some sort of elaborate description of the food and/or service...don't.  You're wasting time reading any further....just stay away from this garbage and try another Brazilian spot"
"2","This is a pretty good Qdoba location. I'm not the biggest fan of Qdoba, but the service is really friendly and the restaurant is very clean. \n\nWhen deciding on my order they offered samples of any of the ingredients. It's a great way to get a little taste before committing to anything.\n\nFood was solid and all their produce was fresh, which is key for a salad bowl on the go."
"1","We went to an early dinner today. There was hardly anyone in the restaurant, and after 10 minutes of being ignored by the host, we left.  This is my first time back here in a couple of years, and will never go again."
"2","We chose this restaurant, despite being in a very touristy area, because we wanted something reliable when we were very hungry. Very happy with the menu selection and the food! The servers were very nice as well."
"2","I love Magpie. Great ambiance (cozy, romantic, vibrant), attentive and knowledgable staff and most importantly, amazing food. Not your \""the bigger the better\"" type of place, magpie pays attention to taste first and foremost. The oysters are a must- the raw horseradish as garnish is genius! And the pizzas have just the right ratio of oil/cheese/toppings/dough. Recommended for dates or a place to bring your parents."
"1","expensive for a noodle shop... sure, given that its on the strip (and duh - its in Caesar's) but you can experience better noodles at a hole-in-the-wall pho place.\n\nalso, the servers are not very friendly."
"1","I don't think that I can add much to the already posted reviews, but here goes.\n\nGC is definitely the Walmart of music stores.  It's OK in a pinch, but you wouldn't want it as your mainstay music store.  Support the small shops whenever you can.\n\nThe one good thing about GC is the reason you don't really want to shop there, their return policy.  they'll take anything back.  Keep that in mind when you are buying something \""new\"" there.  Also, there are tons of people who don't know what they are doing going in there everyday and kicking the crap out of their gear.  If you buy something high on the wall or out of a glass case, you are probably relatively safe.\n\nProtip:  You can shop online and have stuff shipped to store and pick it up there, you can save a lot of money on shipping.\n\nProtip 2:  GC, GC.com, and Musician's Friend are all THE SAME thing."
"1","We had never been to this restaurant before, but it was highly recommended by some of our Arab friends. Several people at our group bough a Groupon for this first experience. Service was mediocre, i expected much more for the price, the waitress took a very long time to come take our order (there were only three other tables in the entire restaurant.) I looked at an empty glass of water numerous time, and when we asked about dessert the waitress told us that we could get up and go look at the display! Food was delicious though, I'll give the kitchen staff that much.  When it came time too pay, the waitress took the first bill along with the groupon, charged it and then proceeds to tell the rest of our party that she can only accept one Groupon per table. So, not only did I pay for the Groupon, I also paid for the full price of the meal! \nThe food might've been delicious, but it is not worth the terrible service. Will never go back to this establishment an will not recommend it to anyone else."
"1","This place has seriously gone downhill. My husband and I took our boyfriend with us to the reef yesterday. The woman who was at the ticket counter was very snotty when we talked about the CCSD employee + 1 guest thing. Apparently they've removed it and made it only 2 days a month now. \n\nWe asked when that had happened, and she got very bitchy and said that we OBVIOUSLY had received an email about it already and should know. Then waved a paper in our face with the dates. Unfortunately for her, no support staff in CCSD have received this email that I'm aware of.\n\nWith the locals price of $13.95, we decided that for $42 + tax, it wouldn't be worth it, considering how short the place is. She even got snotty about it still and rather than being understanding or apologetic or even offering some modicum of customer service, she told us \""You'll have to go in THAT line if you want to come in now.\""\n\nOh well. They've lost our business. Probably on a more permanent level now. Get some customer service skills, please."
"1","Dined here with 3 other people. No one was happy.\nWaitress was clueless (new and untrained?) she wasn't sure what soda they offered. She brought the drinks about 10 minutes after we ordered them, saying \""sorry I was looking for cups\""\nMy lemon on my water smelled like dirty kitchen rag. \nFries were nice and thick, but dry and soggy. Corned beef was hideous, very tough and rubbery. I sent it back for a fish and chips plate that was similar to what I get at CoCo's, but with the big soggy sponge fries.\nHighlight of the dinner, the company and my beer.\nWe will never come back, unless it's only for drinks."
"2","Like Minneapolis & St. Paul. Like Cagney & Lacey. Like Nip & Tuck. Olive & Ivy is beautiful and near some water, entertaining and lesbian friendly and full of people who've had plastic surgery. Great space. Fabulous patio. I know. I know. The canal. Ugh. Love it? Hate it? Hey, it's there people. Embrace it! Like the Brady's did cousin Oliver.  And embrace the Eggs Benedict, Egg Sandwich, Focacciao bread with pesto and CENTER CUT CINNAMON ROLLS! You heard me people! Center cut. No non glazed, hardened, corner piece. Service was outstanding. I noticed the patio filled up just after we arrived. Isn't that weird? Does that ever happen to you? You arrive somewhere. Nothing. Soon the place is buzzing and so are you? Anyway. I digress. We were thirsty fashionistas recovering after a night at Scottsdale Fashion Week...i.e. we were pickled and thirsty. Ice tea and water was a flowin' the entire meal. They saw it in our blood shot eyes I'm sure. Eggs Benedict was perfection and had a delightful surprise of basil on top! Rickie LOVED his egg sandwich with avocado...looked great...though he never offered me any...Hmmm..Olive & Ivy. Like Ebony & Ivory. Living together in perfect harmony. Side by side....ok ok ok you get the picture."
"1","I have been on a wing crazy for several weeks now. We have been talking about trying BWW. We went for a late lunch Saturday. They were busy, but no wait for seating in the bar. We ordered our drinks and had to look over the menu. We ordered the Parmesan garlic wings and the Triple Threat Nachos. When our food finally arived, the wings and nachos were barely lukewarm. The wings were average, different choice of sauces was a plus, but nothing spectacular. The do not have regular plates I guess, since we were given little paper trays.\nWe were not impressed with the food or the service. We will not be returning. The food was way over priced for the quality.\nBetter off going to your favorite pizza place or dive bar for some good wings."
"1","UNfriendly service. BUT worse of all,they starting cleaning the grill before closing. They smoked us out of there!"
"2","This review is for the hotel only !!!\n\nHaving been to Vegas dozens of times and even living there in the early 80's I feel as though I can speak from experience. \n\nHow much time does one spend in their rooms while in Vegas? I don't know about you, but I only sleep, shower and use the bathroom. PERIOD. I have stayed at numerous places on the strip and NEVER went to the pool or gym, so why should I pay the $15 to $20 service charge PER NIGHT that most every other hotel charges. Bill's DOES NOT charge for this ridiculous service.  As for the rooms... as of 2011 they are very clean and spacious with the bathroom on the smaller side but who cares.  I did my due diligence and got room rates of $44.74 on Thursday and Sunday nights with Friday and Sat rates of $89.54 which included taxes and there is NO CHARGES FOR USING A POOL OR GYM.\nDo you get my point on this stupid charge. I have read numerous Yelp reviews where they have been told of this charge upon checking in.  You WILL NOT find a less expensive, nicer hotel on the strip that is in the middle of all the action AND not have to walk a mile or so from your room, past all the stores and restaurants etc JUST to exit the damn place. At Bills you can get from your room to the street in less than 5 minutes.\nPlease stay somewhere else next time I am in Vegas so I can make sure there is a room available for me when I call. Thanks and buyer beware. Oh, by the way, who the hell wants to pay $200 plus dollars for the same room across the street PLUS get an additional $20 charge for using the exercise bicycle. As PT Barnum said....."
"1","They give u large amounts of food but their is no flavor. They give you one plate of food that could very well feed four people at best. So you think I would be happy right but no I feel a lot of things but happiness is not one of those feelings. What good is a lot of food if its tasteless? \nThe staff was nice the place was clean. Food flavorless. Will I return No."
"1","The cap was delish. the barista who made my drink was a rude bitch. If I was an asshole I'd taker dollar back."
"2","Best wings in town.  Order the salt N pepper wings.  Great service too."
"2","We found out this location is a nice walk from our home for a peacefull diner.  The food is great as is the staff.  \n\nOur last visit included hotwings.  While they tasted great, there needed to be some more heat.  The only other thing is they need pitchers of beer."
"1","Today (Thursday, 7/5/12) at approximately 4:30, I contacted this location and listed a few issues that I am currently having with my vehicle. I mentioned that I need to have the freon changed in my vehicle, have the oil changed and also that the vehicle creaks continually. I was told that there may not be enough time to get anything done today and was asked if I could leave my vehicle overnight. I could not, but asked if I could bring the vehicle in tonight to have the freon changed and then come back on the weekend to have everything else looked at. The individual I spoke with told me to come in as soon as possible because they close at six and were working on several things. I agreed and arrived as soon as I could, which was 5:00 PM. When I arrived, a gentleman with dark gray hair was behind the counter. He did not smile or ask how he could help me, but I explained that I called a few minutes ago and that I was experiencing the aforementioned issues. He then bluntly told me that his techs leave at five. He then asked if I could leave the vehicle overnight and I said that I couldn't and again reiterated what I was told on the phone in an attempt to get some kind of apology for driving 30 minutes out of my way. He responded, \""Again, my techs leave at five. It's going to take at least an hour for an oil change.\"" I mentioned that I might be able to bring the vehicle in on the weekend and he stated that, if I could bring the vehicle in over the weekend, I would have to leave it. After this brief conversation, he handed me the store manager's business card (which I assume is his). Given that the website doesn't state store hours, I would expected that any individual working at any Sun Devil Auto location should be held responsible for knowing the opening and closing times of the business. I also expect that my time be considered equally as important as their employees' time. Needless to say, neither of these expectations were met. Even a simple apology would have sufficed, but I was not given an apology nor was I treated as though my business is desired or appreciated. Given that I was speaking with the store manager, this was especially disappointing. As a result, I will be taking my business elsewhere."
"1","Been here twice. This review is for my latest visit. It was not good. First of all my burger was pretty dry and the vegetables looked like it was pre packed the night before under a blow dryer. Second, how do you make a caesar salad taste bad? After telling the waiter that it was disgusting and we did not want it nor a replacement he complied and removed it from our bill. When the bill arrived all the items totaled up were completely off. They tried overcharging us by at least $9. I pointed this out and after about 15 minutes of waiting they came up with the story their computers were messing up? Really? C'mon get your act straight. This was a must go restaurant for me to go to every vegas trip, But Id rather settle for in n out now"
"1","I took my Ford van in because it had a leak when I came to pick it up I was told that the manifold was the problem and that it would cost about $450.00.  I decided to take it to get a second opinion. At that point the representative said it will cost you $125 because we had to put it through our machine to check it out. I asked it that cost would be applied towards the cost if I had the repair done and he said no.  I found it odd that no mention of having put it through their computer was mentioned until I said I was taking it for a second opinion.  In conclusion the second place found nothing wrong with the manifold.  This place is not to be trusted!!"
"2","Smoky Jon's is some of the best BBQ I've had in Madison.  However, I haven't tried many places, so that's not saying much.  I really enjoy the ribs and the pork shoulder sandwich.  The brisket is good as well.  I have found all the barbecued menu items to be flavorful and tender.  The burgers aren't that good, however; they're overdone and greasy.\n\nThe sides also leave something to be desired.  I've never had a bad side dish, but I've only really been impressed by the fried biscuits.  The mashed potatoes are runner-up.  The pasta salad and potato salad are both well below average.\n\nService at Smoky Jon's is both quick and friendly.  Employees will remember you, which is always nice.  The prices are good.  The location is a little iffy, though; the parking lot is too small and the building itself can feel cramped.\n\nAll problems aside, I will keep coming here for the delicious BBQ."
"1","My wife an I travel often. We choose carefully where we stay. We have no kids and we like night life. The chances we stay at the W Scottsdale again is less than 10%. I feel that the W Scottsdale is not suited for a couple that is having an extended stay,(more than a weekend). That being said the valet staff and the original woman that checked us in are great!\n\nLet me explain;\n\nUpon check in we were pleased that we were upgraded to a corner suite (because we were staying 6 nights), at the same time we were informed that it was over the pool area and it might be loud. My wife and I planned on hanging out there anyway so it was a non issue. Upon returning from a late dinner that night with another couple we did go to the pool bar. Our friends that lived there locally were shocked that he place was near empty. Still the music was going so we chose to stay. Within 20 minutes the DJ changed the music from progressive house to Taylor Dane pandering to the only other people there besides us. Kinda lame, but whatever we just left and went to our room. \n1AM, my wife put her iPhone in the dock and the four of us were talking and laughing for the next 20 minutes. The reason I know this, the music ended at the pool at 1:15 and security was at our door at 1:25. Great first night!\n\nAs long as the W Scottsdale is making noise until 2:PM everything is good, but if their party is not making money everybody has to be quiet.\n\nNow I believe everybody was given the warning that the pool area was loud, so each of our neibors were told as we were, but we made no issue of it and complied. Instead the next day I asked a woman at the front counter if there was a room away from other guests that we wouldn't be bothering anybody, thinking we might since we had 5 more nights. She looked at me like I was from another planet, as if she couldn't look in the computer to see how; (not close to) full the hotel was! Once again not a great experience. \n\nWe would have gladly had our original room. it seemed that we were herded with other guests like cattle so the staff had it easier. \n\nProblems with the room:\nEvery flat space is covered with stuff to purchase. We had to move everything to the floor losing the sq footage that is promoted online when booking. \n\nBurnt out light in bathroom. The lighting in the bathroom is so poor anyway! Does anybody from your corporate office understand that women put makeup on and generally get ready in the bathroom? Two drawers, limited counter space, but plenty of wasted floor space. A moderate redesign with a makeup mirror would help us guys out greatly.\n\nWe couldn't use the in room safe; the battery was low and didn't feel like waiting on the staff to figure out how to change it out.\n\nThe curtains don't close all the way, but that doesn't matter because, you can't sleep in anyway  for the shower window has no shade at all, and you might as well have a sunlamps in the room!\n\nNo hooks for robes or places to hang towels after use for re-use.  Not very \""green\"" by today's standards.\n\nWe called multiple days to have a rug returned, a robe returned because the staff didn't supply the room with all that is standard. Exactly what a guest wants to do past 11:PM....waiting on a staff member to come up to your room. But use anything from the mini bar and/ or liquor and it is restocked daily!\n\nI needed to use the in room computer, which wifi cost is a premium at your Hotel, but the batteries in the mouse were corroded. I dropped the mouse off at the front counter on our way to dinner....never to see it again. Another passive money stream unusable for your hotel.\n\n\nWe also had another issue. We checked in using a AAA promotion that included drink tickets. We were given 2 each upon check in, not thinking anything of it. Our friends that live in Scottsdale visited us and stayed only one night received 2 also using the same promotion. The next evening we asked a person at the front desk about this and they suggested that we contact the manager for the drink tickets as they are handed out liberally! (I guess that is unless you book online and stay for 6 nights). I looked at him and suggested that he wrote a note to the manager and had them contact us...... never happened.\nI believe that the promotion for drink tickets is to help keep guests at the hotel so the chance to spend their money, is spent internally. Much like Vegas. \n\nAll of the above items could have been easily remedied but would have taken time out of our vacation that we would never get back. So I chose to deal with it the way I chose to. The number 1 thing for me is for us to have a great time but certainly make my wife's time off work memorable....not for the shortcomings of a bad hotel stay.\n\nWow we were just two guests for one week.\nWhatever Whenever except when you stay at W Scottsdale!"
"1","Surprise never Surprises me when it comes to a nice dining experience.  It is consistently below average.  It took a long time to be greeted at the table. The lady server was unpleasant and gruff  but seemed to take on a more pleasant attitude later on.  We were served our dinner and did not see her for awhile and then she presented the bill when I was still eating my dinner. \""NO RUSH!\"" is what she said as I had my fork to my mouth. Ugh. Fortunately for the business I did notice a young man serving tables near us and his demeanor was awesome and accommodating to the patrons he was serving.  I was envious and would have paid double to be waited on by him.  We rarely have time to eat out, so this is a place we will not be revisiting."
"1","I will have to add that the manager reached out to me because of my unpleasant experience and offered a discount for the next visit. It shows that there is someone caring and that is a good sign. That is why I will give a second star.\n\nNevertheless, I won't be back."
"2","The ramen here is just 5 star perfect, flavors are delicate and unique, Gyoza is perfect too. Usually packed to the max, waitress is super rude with some BS attitude, wonder where it came from. Wish they were friendlier, would make this place a 5 star."
"1","Not impressive at all. I went in hoping to look for baby gear and there was not much merchandise. I am not a big fan of kid to kid or hissy fits but I would chose those stores over this place. I put my son in the kids area and the rug reeked of old gym socks and as I walked around I realized the entire store had a stench. Toys were in bad condition and I didn't even take a look at clothes because it couldn't handle the smell. I am a second time mom and have been on a budget since my first child so I know quality and a bargain this place has neither. I gave two stars because a few of the toys out front were worth looking at but that's it."
"2","I had a very nice lunch at Alchemy. I had the fried perch sandwich and it was delicious. My one complaint is that I might have preferred a thinner slice of bread because it was a bit overpowering. Overall the balance of the flavors of the sandwich was nice and I would definitely order it again.\n\nMy mom went with the stuffed grilled cheese and Alchemy fries, both of which she really enjoyed! I got a chance to try the fries, which were crispy yet still soft and absolutely amazing!\n\nThe star of my meal at Alchemy was the daily soup special, a coconut, beet and ginger puree. The waitress let us a sample the soup before ordering it, which I really appreciated. Upon my first bite I was so in love that I ordered a bowl on the spot and proceeded to finish the whole thing. It was amazing!\n\nI really enjoyed the atmosphere and food at Alchemy and will definitely return to experience their outdoor seating this summer."
"1","I stopped in here on a whim after being unable to find my original destination. \nI give the drinks a 4, very good, but not the best. \nI give the food a 2. It was edible but my pad that tasted like watered noodles. \nI give the atmosphere a 3. Had pretty cool decor, but was really loud and unpleasant for me. Couldn't really carry on a conversation. \nThe fortune cookie was tasty but the fortunes are terrible attempts at dirty humor. \nI give the service a 3. My boyfriend had a soar wrist and wanted a fork. 5 minutes later he gave up and ate with a spoon. Eventually he did get his fork. I pretty much sat drink - less for the 2nd half of my meal. But I know the staff has a lot to do here so I'll do my best not to be a bitch. \nI would give this place a 3, but after 2 drinks and 2 entrees I ended up paying 100 dollars. I have to say being completely overpriced has costed a star in my review."
"1","I would love to be able to give this place a positive review for its food, but unfortunately since I never got to try it, I won't be able to. \n\nIndaba really let me down in the simplest of ways. I called on a Wednesday evening to make a reservation for the upcoming Saturday. I made sure to repeat my request for a table for 8 people, at 8pm on Saturday evening several times to ensure that the lady I was speaking to got it right. \n\nImagine my surprise when I turned up at 8pm with 8 people on Saturday night and there was no table for us! The host and hostess initially felt quite strongly that we were responsible for the miscommunication over the table booking, despite the fact that in the booking book, the lady had got not only the date for the reservation wrong, but my name, my phone number, and the amount of people my table was for! I was really disappointed as I think it's pretty fundamental that a restaurant should be able to take a booking over the telephone correctly - but they hadn't got one single part of it right!\n\nCustomer service is such an important way of building up and maintaining a loyal customer base, and had the owners of this restaurant managed to overcome their error in a suitable way, they may still have salvaged their reputation with myself and my group of friends, however, everything about this experience was quite unpleasant and it really makes me reluctant to give this place a second chance, which is shame as I was really looking forward to trying it. \n\nNot only did Indaba lose out on a big booking on Saturday night, but they also have lost out on our future custom, and the future custom of family and friends, who are keen to take all recommendations I can give them for good places to eat in Edinburgh. Shame."
"2","For a more dressed up casual and quaint place I love coming to banderas. Owned by houstons and Hillstone, it's dark inside which makes it comfortable and romantic. It's good a night out with family/friends or a date spot. Everything on the menu is really good and the service is phenomenal."
"2","I usually play basketball at around 11:00 am and got rejected by the wet floor for a couple of times. I guess that's the only issue why I give 4 stars."
"1","Where the heck is the M&M tour?!? \n\nI remember coming here sooo many times just to walk through the tour they had upstairs showing you how M&M's are made! It may be childish but it's probably the only reason I ever came to M&M World!\n\nFor those of you that have never experienced the tour, then good for you, you don't know what your missing so I'll just go with the usual garb:\n\nLots of M&M colors and flavors\nLots of M&M crap\nLots of kids runnning around like sugared up trolls\n\nUtterly a boring waste of time without the tour."
"2","Ive been here many times while visiting Las Vegas.  Makinos is a very good japanese buffet.  Lots of different japanese foods and tons of sushi.  All different kinds of sushi and they use good cuts of fish!  Everything is fresh (or sometimes fresh frozen) but everything tastes good.\n\nThis last time I enjoyed the sushi and shrimp tempura.  The udon wasn't that good this time.\n\nFor dessert, the almond cookie (flat cookie) and fresh fruit dipped in the chocolate fountain where good."
"2","Oh those Canadians! They are a funny bunch and Gordie is one hilarious Canuck!\n\nFor the price of the ticket, he was a solid 90mins of laughs. There were some definite    lulls, but they were immediately followed by a funny impression and/or well timed joke.\n\nThe show is a hodgepodge of celebrity impersonations, some better than others (his Jim Carrey is so good it's scary!), songs, comedic observation, and audience interaction. \n\nIf you are looking for a good evening show for under $40 at the Nugget and right off Fremont, this is it. You will definitely leave haven been shown some funny for the money!"
"2","This place is great. Just a dinky pizza joint, but its usually not too busy and pretty affordable for what you get. Show up and get 3 slices and a couple beers for $10. Great for football games. I usually show up at 3 or so on college football Saturdays, pick a spot right in front of one of the HDTVs and kick back. Friendly staff, pretty clean, and not loud or obnoxious. I plan on becoming a regular here and recommend it to everyone."
"1","If you are looking for friendly service, opt for the location on Guadalupe and McClintock instead. My visit here today reminded me why I typically drive a little bit further in order to avoid this location. Checkout girl didn't even bother to push my bagged groceries towards the end of the belt so I could easily load them into the cart. And the girl at the bagging station walked away right as the cashier finished ringing everything up. As I was loading my cart the disinterested cashier says one word, \""eggs\"" and hands me my final bag. Just kind of a pathetic experience."
"2","Tucker did an exceptional job helping my wife and I find a house in the Arcadia area. His knowledge and expertise and the way everything was handled was nothing less than excellent! Not only was he thorough in his quest to find us the perfect house but he was attentive and flexible making the entire experience enjoyable. I would have no problems referring his name to others - he's one of the best real estate professionals in the area, and I highly recommend him."
"2","Great Wine Selection among everyday low prices."
"2","Have been to Brio twice recently and enjoyed both visits. Sat outside on the patio when the weather was perfect. Drinks were average price (prosecco) and food was reasonable (half chicken with veggies). Service was fine - nothing great, nothing bad. The location is quite nice and I enjoyed the 'upscale' feel of the Piedmont Row area. \n\nI would recommend it."
"1","I was very disappointed.  A group of us went on a Friday night for live music.  They are in dire need of an interior decorator.  We felt awkward as soon as we walked in the door.  There were basically picnic benches for tables and nothing on the walls.  The beer was good but the atmosphere is lacking."
"1","SHOULD BE NO STARS, ONCE AGAIN.\n\nMy family has frequented this location several times.  Usually, we order quite a few things, however, I came from across Taco Bell because my little one wanted rolled tacos.  Also, maybe I was able to catch this mistake because I only ordered one plate, instead ordering several items and never catching it before.\n\nI placed an order for #1 which is rolled tacos, rice and beans.  The order should have been $5.75 and tax, however, I gave my debit card and was charged $8.16.  When I got home, I checked the receipt and noticed I was charged for #11 which was $7.55 and with tax, came to $8.16.\n\nI am not hispanic, however, I do know when the clerk turned around and told the cook \""numero 1, pollo) I thought I was getting charged for the correct combo, not being overcharged for something I never ordered.  I was quite surprised my order was correct, just not the pricing.\n\nThe next morning I called the restaurant and was told Manwell was the manager and to get a hold of him I would have to call around 7:00 a.m. to get a hold of him.  I tried this morning and got several people who could not understand me to finally find someone who could speak to me in English to tell me his name is Javier and he was the manager.  When I informed him I was told Manwell was the manager, he told me to call back in a couple hours.\n\nI have yet to speak to the manager, yet; however, I need to know if this is normal practice to overcharge customers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"1","My experience at this restaurant was probably one of the worst I've ever had. My friends and I went there for a Suns game and were seated at a booth near the door. As we were sitting there, a girl who was waiting for a table, looked above our table and saw a cockroach crawling right over our table. Now granted, I have a phobia of bugs, and especially roaches, but this seems to me, like a pretty big deal. After the initial scare, I informed our waitress of this and she freaked out for a second, and ran off to tell someone. She didnt return for another 5 minutes, though it was only to bring drinks. I then told the host near the door and he exclaimed that it was horrible and he walked away(apparently to get someone?). After another 10 minutes still nothing happened so I found the guy again and told him nothing has been done yet. By this time, the others at my table had gotten their food. He told me that since it was so high on the ceiling there was no way for him to get to it. Now, I'm no engineer, or trained exterminator, but I had about 2-3 different ideas on how to get to the roach. I didnt realize he was stumped. I felt like I should make a bigger deal about it, but instead I left. I don't feel like anyone should be forced to eat in those conditions, without at least an attempt to rectify it. I mean, I dont have any delusions about spic and span restaurants. I know restaurants are dirty, but to have a roach hanging over our table is unacceptable. And the only reason the management would do nothing is because it would have made a scene. I guarantee you if everyone else in the restaurant had seen it or was experiencing it, SOMETHING would have been done. For us to have to endure it because no else was being affected is basically saying we dont matter enough for them to do anything. \n\nHow was the food you ask? I didnt even see it since I was focusing on the large roach hanging over my table."
"2","The chicken wings with out the bone are the best I've had in quite a while."
"2","Read the reviews and tried it first in February, 2013. The food and service were terrific.  The value it incredible.  We like to go to local restaurants while on vacation. Came back August 17, 2013, this place is fantastic!  Tender, moist chicken strips with all but two sauces homemade.  Try the teriyaki sauce with wasabi.  The couple next to our table, from Seattle, they also found the restaurant on yelp,  but researched 'Best Mac & Cheese in Vegas'. The Mac n' Cheese is the best I have ever had,  individually made and baked to perfection.  Mat delivered each order making sure customer was completely satisfied.  Rarely do you receive this high level of customer service anymore.  Will come back every time I am in town.  The name is changing to Strip n' Dip due to name duplication with a fish restaurant in another town.  Doesn't matter what the name is, you will call it delicious."
"1","So I stopped in here because Vietnamese food is generally one of my absolute favorites, however this place failed on every avenue.  I walked in and was barely greeted after wandering around for a minute... I put in a simple order of Chicken fried rice to go then she walked away leaving me in the middle of the restaurant so I went and had a seat at the front door.  This place isn't to well organized for walking in and ordering food to go.  So I waited about ten minutes and then went out to my car for maybe 5 minutes and when I came back in I saw a to-go box sitting near the hostess counter which I assumed was my order... after waiting another 10 minutes or so the waitress (who wasn't busy) came over and asked me to pay, which I did... then she handed me my cold food.  Waiting approximately 30 minutes for an $11 order of chicken fried rice was kinda shitty considering there were only a total of 4 customers in the entire restaurant.  When I got home to eat my food I wasn't very impressed with the portion size for the money and the food was so bland to top it off!  There wasn't much of anything I could do to doctor it up so I reheated my cold flavorless meal and ate as is.  NOT IMPRESSED\n\nFYI, the best place for Vietnamese food in my opinion is Noodles Ranch located @ the SE Corner of Thomas & Scottsdale road in Scottsdale.  Their food is to die for!  Less expensive, more authentic and full of flavor with the friendliest wait staff you could ask for.  It's 100% worth the drive no matter where you live.  So, if you like Pho Da Lat... do yourself a favor and go try Noodles Ranch."
"1","Again another reported burglary on 12/8/13 3 days from my incidental this apartment complex & I also found out my neighbor was burglarized 3 months ago. pull up alertid.com to see all recent incident reports for this place- Again this place does not care about your safety! Don't be fooled by the low prices, you will end up paying more a month I recommend setting up ADT or another security monitoring system before you dare moving into this place!"
"2","I came here (gasp!) not for the pizza, and I was soooo impressed.\n\nThis place does nothing cheap or low-end.  Every ingredient is carefully picked and often of the organic/sustainable variety.  The dishes are carefully thought-out, and pay close attention to flavor profiles and presentation.  The meat and cheese plate was fantastic, the polenta is an absolute must here, and the clams were just great.  Way better than expected beer and wine list too.  The servers know their stuff.  Foodies will love it here.  The price is right for what you get, which is a nice surprise too, considering I expected more of a Strip mark-up.\n\nThank you 550 for not catering to the drunk slob crowd, but still finding a way to please them too."
"1","This place has decent decor for a valley Indian restaurant and very average food. The dosas at Ananda Bhavan or even Karaikudi are way better! The service is quite inadequate and even rude at times. Quite frustrating."
"1","Horrible service. Server comes to the table on his phone and asks if we know what we wanted after seating us 2 minutes prior.... sorry we took take time away from your Facebook updates. Then we had to go up on our own twice to get water since no one was around."
"2","Amazing curry. Sooooo affordable. Butter chicken is to die for. Chicken tikka done great. Been dozens of times and will go back. Their naan bread is wicked. Feels authentic in terms of the food. Minus the beef curry but still delicious. Go. Eat. Here. When you crave curry."
"2","If you know me personally, you know that I'm a die hard deep dish pizza kinda woman. So why on earth would I even agree to dine at a flat bread, thinly sliced pizza spot? Well, I'm a natural born foodie, so...no judgment and my theme is \""Bring on new experiences with food anytime, anywhere!\""\n\nThe bf and I were in town for a wedding so of course during our down time we wanna explore what Henderson has to offer when it comes to food and culture. \n\nI honestly wasn't even hungry at the time we showed up since we literally had breakfast 2 hours before but this is the kinda schedule you gotta be on if you're dating a FOODIE bodybuilder. :P\n\nWe ordered the Vico Pizza Pie which had Wood Oven Sausage, Sauteed Fennel, Red Onions, Mascarpone, Mozzarella, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil. All those ingredients sound amazeballs, don't they? Well, they sure were!\n\nOne thing that was off though was that our waitress told us that they serve their pizza Napoli style which means we have to cut into our pizza with our own knives and forks and that they do pre-cut pizzas at the customer's request but it's not standard. Our pizza...came out cut for us? WTF. We're all about authenticity and we were looking forward to cutting into the pizza and into the soft \""wet\"" center ourselves. Oh well, I'm not going to knock down a star just for that. \n\nThe pizza was seriously amazing (mascarpone and mozzarella me anytime baby) and I'd totally come back here to try some of their other pizzas or specials they have. :)"
"2","The doctors here are super informative and, from the few experiences I've had, are always willing to diligently devote their time to resolve your worries and pains. The service is quick and reliable with a handy 'drop in' clinic available for temporary patients (such as students etc).\n\nThe staff are respectful, the waiting room and general environment of the practice is pleasant. \n\nAs a medical practice it does everything you could expect and more."
"2","First off in response to some of the complaints about cover and drink pricing; 10.00 isnt bad, if your pinching pennies then yes. Drinks arent that bad, bottle domestic should not be 6.50 though. As far as the women, fairly approachable when there are women present. It seems as of recent its been a sauage fest."
"2","I have always liked Cartel since living in Tempe. But not that I live in Phoenix I am glad there is one closer to me, I am also happy that they extended their hours. The coffee is great and the food is pretty good too. I had a veggie breakfast burrito the other day and I have to say it was really good. \n\nThey are committed to awesome coffee and I love that."
"1","I suppose the upside of a bad first date is that i've now tried a new restaurant to Yelp about, and I didn't even have to pay!\n\nThe atmosphere:\nI really liked the look and feel of this place. There was a large patio which was quite full of folks enjoying the nice weather we have right now. We sat inside the restaurant which was not as crowded. The colors and decor are trendy, with a relaxed vibe. The music selection was very good, though much too loud. \n\nThe food:\nWe started with the crab puffs. I'm not sure what the dipping sauce was that they came with but my date seemed to like it. I, however, was not a fan.  Next was the sushi. We ordered California rolls and Las Vegas rolls. Not very adventurous, I know, but they even managed to go wrong with these basics! I would have to declare these the worst sushi rolls I've ever had. \nDessert - the saving grace. We ordered the green tea ice cream and I was surprised when they brought such a large bowl to the table! This was quite enjoyable.\n\nWhile I won't be back here for sushi, I can see where this may be a good place to have a cocktail or two. Some of the selections on the drink menu sounded quite good, and very reasonable happy hour prices. I refrained from trying any though since I was with someone who doesn't drink."
"2","I can't believe I haven't left a review for TSNH2! I've been to many of the Thai places around this area and always end up back here. It's inexpensive, open late, less than a 5 minute drive away from my house, and they've got some key menu items that keep me coming back.\nLike several other Asian joints, the service is probably not what you'd expect. Once in a while, they'll forget to give you a napkin or have to go back to grab your utensils and there might even be some miscommunication, but the food is well worth it.\nNot a huge fan of their pad thai, but I love their duck fried rice and pretty much any of the curries. The portions are generous and the food doesn't take very long either. \n\nCheap Thai cuisine that tastes good within 5 minutes of my home... Uhm. What else is there to say?"
"1","Went there as I found on Groupon.... will not return - not because of the beer but because of the absolutely rude and lousy service.  We sat down and only a few people were at the bar - barely an ackowledgement we existed.  Took an extraordinary amount of time to finally get served.  Most beer was good -though a little warm.  Our groupon included glasses - they almost slammed on the bar giving them to us.  I love local micro-brews.. had potential - but will not go back until they improve service"
"2","Best Chinese food ever! Soooo addictive! Try the ginger beef. I cannot get enough of it. And the soup is out of this world. Everyhting is amazing! And their proportions are totally generous. Omg! Get me the phone! :)))"
"1","This place really sucks.  I wish I could say it in some better way, but if you try it you will know what I mean.\n\nThe single worst part of it isn't even the limited variety, it is the SALT LEVELS in the food!  Avoid if you value your appetite."
"1","Drinks $16 (16 oz. cups full of ice);  ATM $12.50 service fee per $100 withdrawal.  Ask to stay in the central tower,  otherwise you have to walk about 1000 feet to the elevators.   The restaurants are outrageously priced - go out on the strip to eat and drink- you'll find fairly priced restaurants."
"1","WARNING DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!! Whatever you do stay away this place is back under the old management and it's terrible. Been shut down by the health department so many times!! Most of the stuff they serve is from restaurant depot and is not very good quality. Please save your time and money for all sushi restaurants sake. So sad the other owners didn't work out the food quality went way up now it's just crap like before."
"2","Good price, good food. Coconut shrimp were great! The owners & the rest of the staff were very friendly. Beef w/ garlic sauce was nice & spicy - we ordered it at a 5 on the 1-10 spicy scale & that was perfect if you like spicy. Pad Thai w/ chicken was also very good. Definitely will eat here again :)"
"2","I cannot say enough about the staff at this office. They are some of the kindest, most thoughtful, empathetic and sympathetic people I've ever had the pleasure to deal with.\n\nRecently, the time came for our 19-year-old cat, Chloe, to leave us. Our vets office could not see us until the following day and we knew that she should not suffer through the night. We called Hayden Road Animal Hospital because we had previous lived nearby.   Brandi and Dr. Ryan were amazing. The receptionist - I'm so sorry that I forgot her name - was so kind and accommodating. \n\nWe made an appointment for another of our cats to see the doctor. She needed a second opinion. Though Dr. Ryan had a similar diagnosis to the previous vet that our Bella Blue had seen, his bedside manner and explanations were far superior.  \n\nI cannot recommend them highly enough. If I could give 6 stars, I would!"
"2","I would hardly call this a dive bar. It's a little too nice for that. But it's pretty rad. Sort of wish this establishment was in Philadelphia. I think it'd be a big hit.\n\nThis place is, you got it, bike themed! Interesting bikes hang from the ceilings intertwined with christmas lights. Rims decorate the walls. Even old bike parts make up new things in the decor. \n\nI came here on a Sunday night. Not exactly the busiest time, so I have no idea what this place gets like on a weekend. But it was quiet and they have some pretty good beers on draft. The draft beers are a little pricey but the mix drink my friend got was on special. It was in a pretty big glass for only $2.50. I got a Troeg's Mad Elf. Delicious!\n\nI hear they have a good menu with vegetarian options but the kitchen was closed when I went.\n\nThe guy working the bar was pretty nice and chatted with us and some other patrons about the show that was on TV and other such things. It was nice and quiet. \n\nThere's also a back room with more seating that was closed when we were there. \n\nI can really see this being a pretty rad place. I want to come back when I can get the full experience."
"2","Excellent food. Great service and at a great price. From where I come from. This is a reasonably priced out all you can eat meal. \nLand unlike other places. They bring the food to you , saves you from exercise. \nDefinitely coming to eat here whenever I'm in Vegas !!!"
"2","I went to their weekly Sunday Pupu (appetizer) brunch which includes a special Hawaii Pupu menu + the regular AYCE lunch menu for the same price as a regular lunch AYCE, pretty good deal if you ask me. Ive eaten at the sushi side a couple of times and just as it was before the service was eeeh ok at best, i expected better and faster service since its not always full capacity when we go.\n\nI really enjoyed the extra pupus that you can order, my favorite was the \""seared garlic-peppered ahi belly\"" that was the best thing on there, but the only bad thing was that it was limit one order per person, so i recommend getting that as one of the last of your sushi orders, my favorite dessert from the pupu menu was their small slush or ice cream float shot, the one on the menu this time as the green apple slush float shot, it was very very good i got a brain freeze after downing a couple lol. The rest of the menu was just ok nothing really special.\n\nFor the grill side i always used to drive 8 miles just to get their bento or malasadas, pretty far drive just for some food but its worth it when i have the Hawaii food craving, i don't go there much anymore since i always hit up the IslandbreezeLV truck which is almost always closer to me than Island Sushi."
"2","My wife and I are from PHILLY and when it comes to sandwiches, we know what good is. This establishment makes a 5 star sandwich, hoagie, sub or whatever else you want to call it.  They pack the roll with top quality meats and cheeses that are so yummy you can't stop eating, even when your stuffed. The portions are more than ample. A large sandwich is plenty for two people. \n\nAs an added bonus, if you purchase the yelp coupon for $10 and spend $20 or more you receive $10 off the bill. (I assume this refers to sandwiches, only). In any event, offering 50 per cent off is a major sacrifice for a small business. Especially in this inflationary market. \n\nFor us, it was a win, win situation. and we felt it was only right to return their generosity by spending a little extra and TIPPING the nice lady who made the sandwiches. \n\nBTW, while I was waiting for my sandwich the board of health inspected the place and replaced their already existing A-rated cert with a more current A-rated cert. \n\nIf you can recognize a good deal and appreciate an immaculate eatery with high quality deli meat, and large portions I highly recommend the House of Vino."
"2","So the big gripe here seems to be that they have a hard time finding accounts because they want the associated phone number.  They wanted that from me too, but I didn't have one, so I didn't know.  Did I have to wait while the guy tracked through systems?...yep...but let's be honest...he was on the other end of the line working pretty diligently to *find those numbers*...it's not like I was the only one stuck.  Why didn't I have those numbers?...  Because I had a few hours previous cancelled my phone line.  \nWhen i cancelled it, btw, I got no flack, no pressure, the phone was canceled and my bill dropped.  Significantly, I might add.  The girl was helpful and cheerful and polite.  This is in stark contrast to the constant effort to up sell me when I cancelled my cox service...\n\nThen my issues...I had this weird glitch thing going on where my service would die, and my TV would make these terrible noises and a couple other bugs.  They did track down my account, and then the tech in the NOC traced me *by address* as a last straw and reset my box.  He stayed on the line while I tried to recreate the overload that caused the issue in the first place.  No issue, but he was obviously going to stay put until I let him go.  I did...no flack, no pressure, the problem was resolved and my tv worked.  He wasn't overly cheerful, he was just a tech doing the things that techs do and fixing the problem.  Efficient.\n\nIn the end, part of the problem was that I was on some other system used to track prism tv.  This might have been a line of malarky to buy them time, I don't know, but it might help some of you if you have an issue.  Maybe it makes a difference.\n\nMy service works.  My customer support was fantastic. My bill got lowered.  All it took was patience enough for the guy to do his job."
"1","Went here with yelper Evan T so this review might seem redundant, but seriously WTF?\nYes, this place had been open for a mere week before we choose it as our dining destination, but if your gonna open up in Vegas, you better have your shit together. There are tons of casinos/hotels/restaurants doing things the right way, just copy and paste. JS failed to do that.\nThree hungry dudes and tapas should have been a perfect match right? Wrong. The food was extremely forgettable, with the worst item being the one recommended to us by our server, the overcooked lobster with canned pineapple skewer.\nAs unmemorable as the food was, the service is not something I will forget. I am convinced we either never saw our waiter or he wasnt working that night, as the gentleman who we kept having to flag down was gracious enough to take our orders but had to keep reminding us that he was not our waiter. \n20 minutes after being presented with dessert menus someone returned to ask us what we would like. \""20 minutes ago we wanted dessert, now we just want the check.\""\nPerhaps this place will work out the kinks over time, but ill let you figure that out since plan never to return."
"2","I love Red Mango and it was my favorite yogurt place when I lived in Seattle. I wish there was more than 2 in Vegas. I love Pom with Mochi! Yum"
"1","This was the worst Chinese I ever tasted. The broccoli was soggy and grayish looking, the beef tasted like rubber and the brown rice tasted like it was sitting all day. I asked for pork fried rice and I got chicken fried rice and it was not good at all. I didn't even get my egg rolls I ordered, even though I paid for three of them. There was so much preservatives in the food that I got a headache that lasted for two days. This was my first time going there and the last time."
"1","My lousy experience with this Jimmy John's started with an overcharge on my debit card. I ordered 1 sandwich and 1 bag of chips for a delivery. The delivery was fast and the food was good, so lets get that out there to be fair. I added an extra star because the food here has always been fine.\n\nI logged into my bank account like I normally do, and there was a $19 charge from Jimmy's. That's one expensive sandwich.\nI called three times. Spoke to \""managers\"" 3 times. My information was taken, and all 3 times, my call was never returned.\nI went there in person; Once again, my information taken, no call returned. There was a general \""I have no idea how to handle this, I'm going to call my boss/area manager\"" and then nothing.\nThis is really poor customer service. My call should have been returned the first day-a courtesy \""I am handling it, I will get your card refunded asap, apologies, etc. \n\nOver charging a customer is a big deal. I gave the tip in cash, so I know that I did not key in a wrong amount when I placed my order online.\n\nThis was their mistake, and no effort was made on behalf of the management to help me.\nThey've lost my business."
"1","I used to frequent this RA on a very regular basis and absolutely loved it. Always received great service and was seated in a timely manner (even during rush time) \nI just went here with a girlfriend a couple of Fridays ago and it was awful. I would give it one star except I'm hoping this might be a one time thing however many signs indicated it is not. \nThe wait was AT LEAST 30 minutes long, thinking it was worth it we waited, saw some friends and they got sat at a table large enough for us all to sit together so we only waited about 20. We were sat outside after being told there were misters to keep us cool. the misters were about 9 ft high and pointing in the wrong direction so we all sat there in an uncomfortable humid state of sweat. \nWe asked multiple times for extra menus and place settings and did not get them until AFTER our food was served. No soy sauce on the table had to wait for that too. My friend and I ordered sake bombers and they gave us water glasses instead of bomber glasses...they said they kept breaking so they don't provide them anymore. What kind of sushi restaurant does not have the appropriate glasses for bombers? They must be really struggling financially. \nOur server was dull and unenthusiastic, no desire to please. Asked for more water and got it about 15 minutes later. If I wasn't enjoying the company so much I probably would have lost it and asked to speak to a manager. Server also didn't get my friends order right and so they didn't get one of the rolls they ordered until we were almost finished eating. Also they took away the mushrooms in the veggie tempura one of my fav items, big bummer for me. \nWe didn't dare order desert even though we wanted it. All of us are very good tippers and we couldn't even decide if this server deserved a tip. We ended up leaving 15% instead of 20-25%. I considered that very generous. \nThere are way too many new sushi restaurants that contend with RA or are better for me to have any desire to go back again. I wouldn't be surprised if this location shut down if they keep up that quality of service."
"2","Kirk and Susie are superb!  Susie does a great job troubleshooting over the phone.  Kirk is prompt, courteous, professional and always thorough!  I will never use anyone else for my A/C needs"
"2","If you're allergic to dust, don't even think about venturing inside Till's.\n\nA gloriously dusty secondhand bookshop, its packed floor to ceiling with bookshelves, cases and tables weighed down with old books,  graphic novels, anthologies, journals and encylopedias. For fiction lovers, there's well thumbed thrillers, mystery fiction, pulp fiction, Queer fiction, science fiction, womens fiction and African-American fiction. If you look closely, you'll also find some brilliant Scottish fiction and poetry by writers like Ali Smith, Jackie Kay, Ian Rankin and current poet laurere, Carol Ann Duffy.\n\nNon-fiction wise, there's hundreds of hardbacks covering everything from art, film and music to history, local knowledge, politics, alternative medicine and spirituality. Unusually, they also have a small but interesting selection of comic books and old movie posters. Unfortunately, I imagine they're probably as vintage (read - yellowed and strong smelling) as most of the books. Nevermind."
"2","Pretty good for the first time! the bread is fresh and the sub is plentiful. quick delivery, and the menu has variety. The ingredients and vegetables are fresh and crispy. I recommend choosing this place for lunch anytime."
"1","Yuck. I went around 2:30 am to the 24 hour pickup. The food was greasy, doughy, and tasteless. It might be the worst Mexican food I have ever had."
"1","I really wanted to like this place, but had a bad experience. \n\n1st time I went - I ordered nachos and they came with \""squeeze cheese\"" mixed with shredded cheese. They were okay nachos, but slightly disappointing with the squeeze cheese...Next time I went, I requested only shredded cheese and had the squeeze cheese on the side in case I felt like dipping. As I was sitting at the bar munching, a cockroach crawled across the bar...I am having a difficult time getting that memory out of my head and have not gone back since!"
"1","Unfortunately we were fooled by her presentation when we first met Julie. She said she would take care of our business and personal taxes needs completely.  During the 2011 tax season, she said she had everything taken care of during the first few weeks of 2012.  when we would call her to see what our liability in taxes would be. She said she would let us know shortly.....well, shortly turned into one week, two weeks....no return call either way to say, \""sorry, been meaning to call, but I am busy, will call you as soon as I can\""....\""not a word or response to our attempts to contact her via email or phone. Suddenly, one day she sent our taxes \""completed\""....with none of the deductions or special circumstances we spoke with her in detail, addressed!  \nWe were furious and had to seek services with CPA who listened to us and corrected all of the mistakes she made.  I say this with no malice, Julie should not be practicing or else stick to completing simple tax forms.  Her management style, organization and people skills need some training.  I am surprised she is still in business."
"1","Actually didn't try the food. Stopped into to grab something to eat after a long day of travel. Bartender closing down his register,  kitchen was getting cleaned up, waitresses were closing out and and doing side work.  When I  asked if the restaurant is still open the rude bartender pointed at the gate across from me and said when that plane leaves they close.  \n\nI walked out of there, who wants to eat at a place that is 99 percent closed down and on top of that they weren't even inviting and said hey we're closing down but don't worry about it,  come on in and grab something we will take care of you.\n\nStay open till you close."
"2","Laurie Roth is the absolute best colorist and hair cutter I have ever had. She is extremely knowledgable and knows how to make my hair look fantastic. Her prices are also very reasonable. She is a gem!"
"1","CRAP service! We had made reservations for at least 16 people for dinner a week prior to dining there. They managed to get the tables together, that's about it. \n\nWhile waiting for our group to arrive, we had drinks outside...we should've gone directly to the Tiki Bar to get our drinks, that woman knew what she was doing!...our \""waitress\"" however, probably couldn't velcro her own shoes. When we sat to eat, we had 2 waitresses (they decided it took 2 to wait on us). One ROCKED IT, the other couldn't velcro her own shoe. Our 1/2 of the group/table had to deal with our appetizers being put in front of us (with a \""who's is it?!?\"" call from the same waitress who took our order) then our meal being placed in front of us not 15 seconds later. My 5 year old daughter not only got a very cold (\""made fresh\"") pizza, but it included something we didn't order....a dead fly between the pizza and plate it was served on. Now...I would've sent it back, but I didn't want to wait until midnight for my kid to get her food! Not to mention my son only got half of what he ordered....\n\nAfter our \""lovely\"" experience with dinner, we stuck around for drinks. All I can say is...you better have cleavage to get a drink inside...no matter how busy or slow they are! If you want to sit and have a drink and look at the lake... Go to their Tiki Bar...Debbie ROCKS!!!! She's the only one that knows what \""good service\"" is!!!!"
"2","The restaurant has a plethora of sports memorabilia that overwhelms its walls. The good news is, it's popular. The bad news is, it's popular. Despite a reservation, we had to wait 30 minutes. They don't have a waiting room, just a sports museum type of long entryway with a very low-hanging ceiling. With a ton of people in the entryway, it started to get very claustrophobic. Once seated, the owner came by and introduced himself. Not sure if it was just because he knew a guy in our party or not, but nevertheless, he was very nice and funny. The waitress had been there for 9 years and was very knowledgable and held good conversation with the table. \n\nAs for the menu, it was pretty pricey. I got a burger for $13 because the cheapest steak was a ground beef for I want to say $19. Pretty pricey all around. My burger was typical, big and tasty. I also tried my buddy's fried chicken, which was awesome. All around the table, the portions were huge. There were several to go boxes at our table.\n\nForgot to mention, MLB commissioner Bud Selig, who has a steak named after him on the menu, came in to dine that night. It was the end of spring training and I'm not sure how often he comes in, but for any sports fan, it's got to be a great endorsement for a place that worships the game of baseball on its walls. Overall, it was a good atmosphere that would make the price worth it on occasion, if I were a resident of Scottsdale."
"2","Since I was heading back to Vegas to visit my parents, I figured I'd drag my sister to try out this place. \n\nIt was a small quaint place, with the cupcakes either in the cooler display or placed on cake display platforms. \n\nI peeked around and they had quite the selection, but I've never been to Sprinkles (myself) to make a comparison. \n\nMy sister got the Red Velvet, while I got the Boston Dream and Baileys ... something I forgot the name. \n\nall three were delectable and the worker/cashier was very nice. We enjoyed the cupcakes on the bench outside and went on our way. \n\nI'll definitely come back next time I'm in town. :)"
"1","It takes a lot for me to slam a company online.  In this case Walker furniture owes me an hour and a half of my life.  I saw an ad on their homepage and decided to head down and treat myself to a Tempurpedic Rhapsody bed with the top line adjustable base.  I told the rep what I was interested in purchasing and he took me to the bed.  I mentioned I would need a new frame as well since I was upgrading from a queen to a king.  When I asked the bottom line price it was many thousands more than the advertised special.  When I brought this up he said that the sale excluded Tempupedic mattresses.  In response I showed him the ad.  He went to find a manager.  He returned five minutes later to inform me that the manager was in a meeting and I could wait if I wanted.  Instead I left my telephone number and asked him to call me.  I never received a call from the manager.  I am asking my friends to support businesses with integrity.  This was a case where a company blatantly advertised false prices (see the ad clipped from their homepage).  It is our responsibility as a community to hold these businesses accountable and demand honesty through our purchases.  I have \""liked\"" Walker Furniture so I could tag them in this photo.  Do not be mistaken... I do not like Walker Furniture.  Please keep this experience in mind when the need arises to purchase furniture in the future... PS.  Mattress Firm took great care of me... I get my bed Wednesday!"
"1","This place was recommended by two different people who did not know one another.  So I thought I should try it.  We walk in and basically seat yourself.  We then sit down and order drinks.  We ask what the specialty rolls are and proceed to order three rolls, edamame and miso soup.  The miso comes out, then the edamame.  We then wait, and wait and wait.  In the meantime there is a couple that comes in after us and gets four rolls.  The waitress apologizes and tells me it will me a few more moments.  Finally we get a roll, it was mediocre at best.  We wait and wait while others around us are getting their food.  Finally I couldnt wait any longer and told the waitress that we wanted to leave.  I will make it a personal goal of mine to go out of my way to tell people how horrible this place is. DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!  I got in my car and went to I love sushi, which by the way is awesome.  I highly recommend the I love sushi roll."
"2","Fun board games and good mango milk tea!"
"2","OK, I popped my Whole Foods cherry.  I did not understand this is a flagship location until after my visit and was totally blown away and found it to be easily twice the size I was expecting.  My plan was to get a cup of coffee and some pastries and then stroll Town Square where I had never been before.  Because I wanted to see everything it took me almost half an hour to get over to where the sell pastries and coffee.  They just don't have some prepared food items, within the store they have a whole food court.  And three different areas to eat.  Gazing at some of the fresh produce and meats I would definitely overspend my food budget if one of these was convenient to me.  The fresh baked pastries were very good but I got the standard house blend coffee and was unimpressed."
"1","A bunch of us thought we'd try somewhere new for lunch and walked away unimpressed.\n\nThe first oddity was walking through the front door that was propped open...in the middle of the day in Arizona...in July.  Then we got to listen to the bartender discuss how to smoke marijuana with someone at the bar for a few minutes before tending to our table.  All of the food was just off.  The Penang Curry tasted like it was mixed with a gallon of coconut milk, the Pad Thai tasted like orange chicken, my Pad Woon-Sen had 3 or 4 small pieces of chicken and a mash up of under-cooked veggies.  The guy that ordered a coke had his drink refilled from a pitcher that had been sitting on the bar long before we arrived.  When asked about getting flat, warm soda we were told that \""its all about the efficiency\"".  My experience was capped by not getting any change from the cash I gave to pay the bill. \n\nUnderwhelmed all around."
"1","Very upset just left. Had recommended by a friend and given a gift certificate to try so we made this date night. Our server never gave us her name. Now we now why. Heavier set Indian girl. We ordered crisp  spring roll with chicken. It should of been cold. It was long time and room temp. She never asked how it was. She stayed in the back the whole time. We asked multiple ?s about our food b4 ordering her answers were basic and she left out so big key points like the mignon was medallions so very rare would be very impossible not 40 mins to make in a kitchen.  She never did any check back on our meal. She pretty much made our experience suck to the point of leaving. Eating nothing. The last straw was asking for Brown rice. I asked but she forgot. And she used it as an opportunity to disappear again into the kitchen for another 5 min to make us think it must need to be a prepared iteam. Like spaghetti in an Italian restaurant. Since my fiance n I have been in the industry for over 15 yrs we'd had enough. 1st I ever left 10% and I know the tip gods understand. I left her a receipt tip as well about her customer service skills. Oh 1 star because the steak was aweful and my salad was covered in minced galic. It wasn't edible. We won't be back. So sad."
"1","I agree with the others.... the food is horrible.\n\nThey do their best at service, and are very nice.... but that is no reason to eat here.  Unless it is a holiday and everyplace in town is closed.... i WOULD choose it over McDonalds.  That isn't saying much."
"1","Bar Louie, I wanted to love you. You got a great makeover in bright colors and fun design, the bar is well designed with nice TVs, the patio is large, and you appear to have a great happy hour.\n\nBut you sucked. We ate dinner early on a Sunday night. We sat at the bar. There were about 8 other tables occupied. We had surly bar service. I got a filthy wine glass (and the waitress forgot my order--look, if you want to look cool and not write it down, that's fine, but you can't FORGET it). It took 35 minutes for a burger and a sandwich. The surly waitress half-apologized, if \""it's the cook's first day back\"" is an apology. We thought the quality of food was atrocious for the price. The highlight was my burger--it was small, overcooked and under-seasoned, but the buffalo sauce with bleu cheese was delicious together. I subbed steamed broc for fries. They were hard and not seasoned. Hubby's steak sandwich was a sad little thing, mostly bread.\n\nHaving said all that, if you just want to get in and out for some fun drinks, this place might be great. It has a lively atmosphere at prime drinking hours. It's great for a drink before or after the movies, but even Cadillac Ranch has better food. Sad."
"1","I'm giving this a two star rating only because the beer was good and our server attentive. The wings were horrible. The place was almost empty and for a Friday night at 6:30, this ain't good."
"1","i was really excited to go eat at this because I've heard so many good things, but i shouldn't always believe what people tell me. First of all the service was horrible. My server was this guy named jeff and i dont know what his problem was. He gave my food to the wrong person so i had to wait even longer on a day that was super busy. Another server had to help because that guy Jeff was of no service. I ordered the chicken which was my first time ordering chicken and waffles and it was nasty. My chicken was dry and i had to drench it in syrup. I was really disappointed."
"1","If you like plain and simple, I will give it to Postino's. The wine list is simple and not exciting, the food menu is just simple. The best part for me about postino's is the atmosphere. I go there to sit on the patio and enjoy some mimosas on a sunday afternoon."
"1","If by \""Mod\"" they mean edgy and weird cuisine, okay - they've got it nailed. Unfortunately, my husband and I were, and can never anticipate again being, in the mood for such fare. We live in the area and had been in the mood for a light bite, thought Renegade would offer such an option with their nice outdoor patio, large indoor bar. Our first reminder that Renegade had a recent turnover in ownership should have been the fact that both were fairly empty -- I've never seen that to be the case at 7 pm. There was no one to greet us; we had to wait for someone to find us a hostess or wait staff person to locate a table, of which there were several, to seat us. And then the menu....I looked at it and realized it had changed. Big time. \n\nBoth my husband and I had wanted a salad, a nice big summer salad. No such luck. There were two appetizer choices, neither of which, we were informed, were your typical salad, as the chef \""does not do\"" that. So my husband opted for a steak salad which a previous reviewer, Joshua J, adequately  summarized. I ordered something like salad in a goblet.  I was told I could send it back if it wasn't to my liking. Trouble was...there weren't any other selections that were to my liking on the limited menu.\n\nThe goblet salad was, to steal from another reviewer, odd. I'd never seen anything like it and that's not a compliment. It was poured out onto my plate, and it looked like glop. Salad soup. Tasted the same.  Dripping in whatever the dressing was supposed to be. It's still sloshing around in my stomach a morning later.\n\nNo bread basket; the alternative was not rolls, it was crispy rye chips. Crispy. Almost inedible. \n\nNot a good experience. Not going back."
"1","I have had only 2 experiences with Sweet Salon, one very positive and the other extremely negative. I, like almost every woman is very particular with who cuts my  hair. So when I found a location near me with a great price I decided to check them out. Had a very good response! The salon is kept very tidy and when you walk in you are welcomed. So I decided to bring my sister back with me a second time so she could experience what I did. I called in for an appointment with the same lady that cut my hair, she was booked, which was fine. We were generated towards another woman that we were told was open. We drove to the salon and were greeted per usual, we waited for about 20-25 minutes before they came to us and told us that the woman who was supposedly open for a haircut, was now no longer available. Really? Where was the communication between us and the stylists and the receptionist? I felt that they handled it poorly. In the end, my sister was advised to make an appointment (that's how we got into this mess!), but for the following week!! I was very disappointed in the service and most likely not be returning."
"2","Amazing, amazing, amazing! Every single aspect of this dining experience was stellar. Mesa Grill was on my radar before arriving in LV so my boyfriend and I decided to make reservations for dinner at around 9:30P on a Friday evening. I'm sure there's SOME room for walk-ins, but I would definitely make reservations in advance if you're planning on going during prime dinner hours. \n\nBobby Flay really put together an incredible menu from start to finish. We started out with the roasted tiger shrimp + corn tamale which kicked off the meal perfectly. All the flavors in the dish just worked together perfectly. We opted to nab two sides instead of a second appetizer and decided on the roasted corn and the cornmeal-crusted chile relleno to go with our entrees. The corn could quite possibly be one of my favorite foods ever -- beyond delicious and seriously a MUST if you're ordering a side. The chile was great, though didn't quite have the same impact. Being a pescetarian, the tuna steak was a pretty natural entree selection for me and it couldn't have been a better choice. A surprisingly big portion and all-around amazing plate. I should say though that we had entirely too much food. We could have JUST had our entrees and I would have been satisfied. One app + two entrees for two people is probably enough unless you're particularly hungry. By the end of the meal I was at the point where I was beyond full but couldn't seem to stop munching because it was SO good! Dessert wasn't even an option for us after over-ordering. When you pop in keep in mind that the portions are actually pretty good-sized (which is a pleasant surprise) and order accordingly. All around amazing. I would definitely come back again next time I'm in Vegas!"
"2","Glasswork Media, LLC was amazing to work with. They spent time learning my business and helped create the perfect video for the business. They were very flexible with their schedule to meet my needs as a business owner. The video they created for my business has helped spread the world about what I do and how I can help others. If you are looking for a talented crew, Glasswork Media, LLC is the business you want to use."
"2","Very relaxed place to work on weekends. But many people use the tables for way too long that you will have very hard time to find tables. It's also next to all the sororities so you see a lot of cute girls ;). Great coffee and sandwiches but definitely pricey. If you get hungry, just go to a Jimmy Johns right next door."
"1","Chew, Chew then search for a polite way to empty your mouth.  Their steaks were non-edible.  With 5 in our party and with a beautiful porterhouse and ribeye we started in with the expectation of an enjoyable meal.  After the first bite we began hoping the next would be better.  By the third piece I was only hoping for a piece I could swallow.  After complaining to the manager he wanted to give us free dessert.  I don't eat dessert.  I went there for the steak alone.   I told him we would give them another chance, after all everyone can have an off day.  After a long story about how they feed their cattle and prepare their steaks we received no resolve, no discount towards another meal...nothing.  The manager was arrogant enough to claim they could never have prepared a steak as we (5 of us) had claimed.  We have all eaten at the Palm, DelFresco, Morton's and others.  Mario Batalia should be ashamed of this experience we encountered and embarrassed by how his staff treated us.  For a good steak and dining experience, stay away from this restaurant."
"1","What's the point, really?\n\nIn the San Francisco area, there used to be a metaphysical shop called \""The Psychic Eye\"".  There are still Psychic Eyes in the Las Vegas area.  When they still had stores in the Bay Area, I used to go there, referring to it as \""the Costco of Occultism\"" because they carried so much incredible stuff.  When I first stopped by the Vision Quest building, my first impression from seeing the outside was, \""It looks like Psychic Eye!\""  With that, I went inside, and my attitude changed from hopeful and curious, to confused, disappointed, and actually rather miffed.\n\nPsychic Eye had EVERYTHING from bulk incenses and oils to books (the Crowley was in a locked cabinet) to magical blades to wall sconces(!) to jewelry and any kind of occulty paraphernalia you could or couldn't think of.\n\nWhen I walked into Vision Quest, I was greeted by. . .bookshelves.  Lots and lots of bookshelves.  On these shelves, there were lots of copies of the same book laid face out for one or more rows so as to give them the illusion of looking full.  Had they been placed spine out, most of the bookshelves would have been substantially less than half filled, and the books that they did carry were largely crap.  I literally wandered from bookshelf to bookshelf looking for something interesting at each one, and was amazed at how few books of real quality I could find.  There was a small area in the center of the store with some crystals, and there was a case near the register with a little jewelry and some other non-descript stuff.  A few shelves and displays were also dedicated to 8 1/2 by 11 colored sheets of paper describing the specialties of the psychics and mediums who work at the site.  They aren't really selling crap here in the store, so this must be their main source of income.\n\nThis store is BIG, and really well-maintained.  They obviously put a LOT of money into the large Tarot card paintings that decorate the walls.  This place could be an occult powerhouse to rival Psychic Eye if they had the inventory to make it happen.  Instead, they have this huge, beautiful facility understocked with lousy books and a few crystals.  It was like using an ornate, sterling silver serving platter to serve a cold Quarter Pounder missing a bun.\n\nOn top of that, the sales lady just stayed by the register the whole time counting money.  We must have been in that store for 40 minutes, and all the while she didn't make eye contact, didn't even look up at us, didn't greet us, ask us if we needed help, or talk to us at all.   In addition, she had one music track playing on repeat over the speakers the whole time we were in there.\n\nVision Quest looks like it was really great at some time in the past.  Unfortunately, that time has come and gone.  From the terrible inventory to the non-existent customer service, few businesses say \""get out\"" to their customers more than this.\n\nWhat is the point, really?"
"2","Lest some readers of this review think that I've suddenly lost my touch or perspective, I can only say in my defense that I have seen the woefully low overall Yelp rating for this establishment and read many of the low-rated reviews, but must nevertheless ignore them and honestly report on my recent trip to the Elephant Bar.   I don't know whether I had an atypical dining experience, or if Elephant Bar staff took heed to recited complaints and improved their food and service, or if other reviewers just encountered a bad day there, but my overall experience was enjoyable, and all dishes I sampled were tasty.  \n\nI began with very good Macau Shrimp Noodle Soup, sporting mushrooms, green onions, white onions, bok choy, and fairly large shrimp in a lightly spicy broth.  It was an unusual and interesting Asian-flavored dish.  \n\nFor my entree, I selected Chicken Marsala, which included a nicely grilled chicken breast, pappardelle noodles, and a mild traditional Marsala Sauce, accompanied by a good cooked tomato half and sauteed spinach.  It was a filling and satisfying display.\n\nFor dessert, what turned out to be a very big order of Strawberry Shortcake tasted good but I could have done without the thin Strawberry Sauce.  I also tried a friend's Creme Brulee, and it was very good.\n\nService was friendly and on the whole very efficient.  Food and drink orders were correctly fulfilled.  But entrees arrived a little early after appetizers and soup.  And, on the initial bill the server had forgotten to credit Senior Explorer card discounts.  This oversight was quickly corrected.  \n\nJudging by this one personal encounter with the Elephant Bar situated in Henderson, and several previous good dining outcomes I have experienced at Elephant Bar restaurants throughout Southern California, I expect to return here fairly soon for other fare, like the tantalizing Chicken Lettuce Wraps with glistening moist bits of chicken, diced water chestnuts, unblemished green shells of lettuce, and peanut sauce that one of my tablemates simply was not willing to share.  Boo!  Hiss!"
"1","Not what it used to be.  Not that the food was ever good, but at least there was a scene.  Now the ambiance falls flat, the waitresses have no smile, there is literally 30 people in the whole place.\n\nThe only good thing was the Italian meat-cutter that came to see us to offer us one very good platter of assorted cured meats.  That was the highlight of dinner.  I don't even want to talk more about the food, it's not worth my typing.\n\nA big no on a place that used to be good at least to dance...  Now, even that is missing."
"1","This is the place. If you're Paris Hilton circa 2004.\n\nThat would make you think I would like this venue. Nah."
"1","The pizza was great. I will eat it again. The servers were a little rude and almost \""too busy\"" to help us but the worst thing was that our server brought our napkin-wrapped silverware to us by carrying it in his armpit. Besides being against the health code, our napkins smelled like armpit sweat and were damp to the touch. We couldn't use them. Order the pizza to go. Don't eat at the restaurant unless you want sweat-stained napkins."
"2","Sub Factory is one of the better sub shops in Tempe - They have been around forever and have a reputation of using the highest quality, freshest ingredients. They may need to give this location a \""make-over\"" soon though... it's getting a little tired. (FYI - their secret weapon is their bread)"
"2","I am tempted to write a bad review so less people go there and the place is only for me.\nI love everything about it. The sushi, the noodles, the appetizers, the deserts..."
"1","It was middle of the day on Halloween when I had visited this store, I had wandered around browsing through their inventory of products. It was completely dead in there and what you would have thought to have good quality customer service turned to absolute shit, their lack of service qualifies about the same as Wal-Mart. They did not have much of a large selection and the small amount of selection that they had was over priced and yet again Made in China products. Worthless attitudes of the people working there, they were not much more different than the Zombies you see in movies.\n\nI've known \""Atomic Comics\"" before this \""Samurai Comics\"" taken over and moved in, you are no Atomic Comics, as a matter of fact they were much more professional, friendly, they were more alive and had a sense of humor and were the kindest of people around. At one point attended an Anime convention there. However no, this Samurai Comics has no comparison next to Atomic Comics. Wish they were still around. I won't be going back there again anytime soon."
"2","In terms of gas stations I like this one the best. The service clerks are nice and helpful, the pumps are easy to use, and there is never a wait. I didn't used to be picky about my gas until I had some costly fuel system repairs and several mechanics made the statement to only use Chevron gas when possible. It's true that you'll spend a little more per gallon, but the quality of the fuel will help maintain your engine and cost you less in repairs in the long run."
"2","Once again Zach and Tremaine didn't disappoint.  These guys were AMAZING!  Professional, fast and careful...a solid triple threat when it comes to moving my personal items.  Hopefully I don't move again soon, but if I did, these would be the guys I requested.  Top notch in every way!"
"1","Dad was injured and we bought a ladder from Costco and they offered to help us load it. We waited 10-13 min and no one came to help us and they just said \""oh they're on there way\"" uhmmm yeah we gotta be somewhere, we're not going to wait 30min for help. All the workers were chit-chatting and ignoring us. Not good customer service."
"2","We stopped in here late one night to try it out, as we are big fans of Gordon. We ordered the sliders, truffle fries, and of course, the sticky toffee pudding. The sliders were very good and adorable. The fries were perfect and they give you the truffle/ garlic aioli to dip as well as homemade ketchup. Delicious. And dessert- sinful. Soooooo good. Wish I would've ordered my own (sticky toffee pudding), instead of sharing. Lol. Lots and lots of beer on tap, although we didn't have any. Fish & chips too pricey at $30-I just got the fish & chip sandwich at burgr instead. ($16 Very good, but standard). Interesting appetizers but some entrees too fancy for my taste. Pretty place, fun ambiance. I prefer burgr @Planet Hollywood. May return if I am in Cesar's."
"1","Was looking for a fast meal the other day and stopped by this location for lunch.  I didn't want a large meal and didn't have time to sit down and eat a Salad, so I ordered a Chocolate Oreo Frosty & Large Fries, ha!\n\nWhat a great combo.....the Fries were OK and the Chocolate Oreo Frosty was awesome!  I really wanted the regular Oreo Frosty, but they were out of Vanilla.....minus 1 Star for that.  I was full after this meal, that's all that mattered.\n\nReturn Factor - 40%"
"2","I want to go back soon."
"2","Whenever I want to see a show or if it's just buying tickets for exhibitions, I like to come here to buy the tickets. Why? Because the tickets are discounted. \n\nIf you go to their website they give you previews of some of the discounted tickets they will be offering, but it won't show all the tickets they will be discounting so make your way down here to check it out. This is right next to the M&M World and World of Coca Cola, you cannot miss this place! Just look at for the huge Coca Cola bottle.\n\nThe lines for this place get fairly long, but they have someone who has a list of shows and the pricing and if you can't see the board up at the front, you can just ask one of these people to see the list. Great place for buying tickets for less, especially if you didn't do your homework and look for deals online before the vacation, like me!"
"1","Terrible. Unless of course you like waiting 20 min to be contacted. Then another 20 to get a beer. And broken darts for the dart board"
"1","Awesome decor, great music and hipster scene, I recommend this place to chill and drink. Besides that the food was greasy, the server couldn't hear me very well probably because of the music, nor could I hear him since he wasn't yelling over the music. The food was over priced for the quality, and left overs stayed on the table don't bother taking home, I am sure it wont taste any better the next day."
"1","Normally I love there food however I tried the new Spicy Chicken Pizza this thing is disgusting my stomach is turning. The sauce is a mae ploy sauce witch I love but not on a pizza makes the pizza sweet, the cheese is ok, The raw onions is hard to eat on it, if they where sauted or caramelized it might be better there was little chicken. This was one of the worse pizza's I have had threw the store I had about 2 slices with this one thats it . Its maddening cause I wanted to like it with all promotion going into this pizza. However thankfully I got breadsticks to eat for dinner :( \n\nDISCONTINUE THIS PIZZA"
"2","Exceptionally fresh, high quality sushi with an inviting yet edgy atmosphere. This is a fantastic place.  Best new sushi bar & bar in Vegas.  Yellowtail Ceviche & the Jalapeno Bomb are two unique and incredibly tasty items.  Tried Banzai Bunny Blueberry Sake because of the picture and let's just say... worth the cab fare!  The staff was efficient and friendly, the bartender is my new best friend (as I recall, Lol!)  They've got an separate upstairs bar for cocktail hour and I'm told they're opening Karaoke rooms next week!  In a word... Fabulous!  I would highly recommend it!!!"
"2","My favs are the Philly Steak Pita and the hummus trio with chicken.  I usually call in my order and pick up because the service there isn't that great."
"2","Mama Gump had the right idea when she said, \""Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.\"" \n\nWhat would've been more helpful advice though, is what to do when your Fido EATS the box of chocolates. YES. I came home one night to find my dog curled up in bed after having YOLO'ed way too hard over an entire box. As in, more than one piece. \n\nSo what's a concerned pet owner to do? \n\n1. Panic. \n2. Google \""Fatality rates for dogs after eating chocolate.\"" \n3. Call a friend. When he says this has never happened to his dog, panic more.\n4. Consult Yelp for a 24-hour vet.\n5. Drive like a maniac. \n\nI called ahead to see if I could get a ballpark on the service, but without seeing my canine, it was pretty up in the air. The vet was quick to explain the what they had done - induce vomiting, give him painkillers, etc., then walk me through what to expect during recovery, leaving me much more at ease. \n\nMore than $100+ later, I learned my lesson that my pet sure loves instant gratification. I'm pretty sure he learned his too - THE MORNING AFTER SUCKS LIKE A MOFO."
"2","This place was off the hook! I was celebrating my bday in Vegas and I chose this place because I didn't want to pay $30 cover and $17 for a cocktail. After gambling a bit in downtown LV and having a few drinks at The Griffin we came here to hit the dance floor. No cover, huge bar, lot's of bartenders, free parking, and a DJ spinning the best Electronica the whole night. He even added some of my favorite indie songs to his list. It was an awesome night of non-stop dancing!"
"1","Great food but HORRiBLE service. place was dead. We frequent the Scottsdale location so this was our first time at the Biltmore location. The server was out of control hyper and was very condescending! The service and professional attitude from the staff in Scottsdale is much better. Very fake when you first walk in. Sean .. Our server was very very rude! Will not be back."
"2","My friend and I accidentally stumbled across Drink & Drag while trying to find Krave this week (both are in the \""Neonopolis\"" complex just adjacent to the Fremont Street Experience in downtown Las Vegas). As it turned out, Krave wasn't open yet, so we headed into Drink & Drag to kill a couple of hours.\n\nTurns out that was a great choice!\n\nThe bartenders are mostly drag queens with the occasional hot shirtless guy, and they couldn't be nicer. There are also go-go boys dancing on boxes who appreciate whatever you want to stuff into their underwear (tee hee), and occasionally there are fun lip-sync performances from the queens. Plus there's a decent-sized dance floor, not to mention the bowling and billiards that are available.\n\nWe really had a great time here, and for a Wednesday night it was pretty lively. No cover at the door, either, so I guess that must vary depending on the night of the week... ?\n\nThe only downside is that some of the drinks are on the pricey side--and $4 for ginger ale seems a little bit excessive. They are pretty big servings, though, so plan accordingly.\n\nThis is a new favorite spot--I'll definitely be back!"
"2","Craig Road Animal Hospital is the only vet I trust. The professional doctors and trained friendly staff are always prepared and ready for any emergencies. They saved my Piggys life and immediately jumped into action to start treating him. I bring both my pitbulls they love Dr.Daniels. She always makes me feel better too. When we would visit we would get the red carpet entry thru the back so we don't have to disturb other visitors. My dogs are aggressive to other animals and I could not find muzzles to fit them. Craig Road ordered me some so we could safely visit thru the front entrance. They offer all kinds of specials work with u financially and really do care! Thank you Craig Road Animal Hospital!"
"2","Ate here again recently, and had the Filet. It was perfect. Very good. And the trio of fries they give you before the meal are all excellent. Probably the best fries I have ever had."
"2","They are one of the few places that have vegan options. It's probably one of two vegan pizzerias in the city. Stop by dig in and enjoy!"
"1","If it was possible I'd give them half a star.. just because my Ice Vietnamese coffee w/ condensed milk tasted ok and my friend's taro tapioca drink was ok.\n\nWhere do I begin, there are soo many negatives that I can write a whole page about this place.  First of all, they were rude when taking our order.  We waved at 3 waiters  and each one told us to wait a minute.  Finally, a girl w/ glasses comes over and takes our order but in the middle of it she runs into the kitchen and does not come back until about a minute later.  RUDE!!\n\nThere are pictures of the food on the wall w/ #s next to them.  You would think that it corresponds to the # on the menu but NOPE.. its not even numbered the same as the menu.\n\nDO NOT ORDER WATERMELON TAPIOCA!  The picture on the wall look like the typical watermelon juice drink one would find at ANY tapioca drink place.  It should be RED... the ones that we got came out looking like blended pepto bismo!!!!  It was PINK... of course we complained and said it doesn't look like anything like that picture.  One guy comes over and said oh its because we use a powder!  So we refused the drink!\n\nWe ordered (2) #19 which was like pho tai w/ flanks.  One came out and I was still waiting for mine, so finally we got someone's attention and told him we're still missing another one of this (pointing at the first #19 we got).  They guy was like whats that, so I said #19, OMG-- they go and open the menu to see what it is and then goes to take the one that we have away.  We were like NO what are you doing!  We ordered 2 of this, leave this one and bring another.  \n\nI swear there are a bunch of morons working in this place!!!!  STRONGLY ADVISE PEOPLE TO STAY AWAY!!!   The food is not even good!!!!  Worst Pho EVER!!!!!  Paying at the cashier you can feel how sticky the floor was!!!"
"1","Fate has great food, but lacks on every other level. I live three blocks away so its upsetting to see a place with so much potential fail."
"1","I guess I'm in the minority, but I was never all that impressed with this place.  The best Indian food in Pittsburgh?  Hardly.  I found it pretty low quality, not very fresh, kind of greasy.  The staff was pretty unfriendly, I didn't feel welcome there.  The one redeeming quality is that it's half price after 10pm, but it's often packed, dark and loud by that time.  It's a decent place if you're having a night out in Oakland and want some cheap drunk food after hitting the bars, but other than that I'd avoid it."
"2","This is definitely my go-to Chinese restaurant in town because it's family-style dining and they serve my favorite dishes. We're usually here with my parents because they love it as well and luckily, my mom has cravings often enough for me to have my fill. We normally order the same dishes when it's the four of us (my parents, Ruben, and myself): Salt & Pepper Calamari (BEST place to order it!), Chicken Chow Fun in Black Bean Sauce (not always consistently delicious, but I love these wide, flat, chewy noodles), Kung Pao Shrimp (my mom's favorite dish; I love picking out the peanuts hehe), Combination Fried Rice (I'm not a fan of their fried rice, but everyone else enjoys it), Chinese Broccoli, and Mapu Tofu (this time I ordered it without meat and it was still good). What a great meal. Honestly, I could come here for JUST the calamari. Very good.\n\nEven with the mostly \""just okay\"" service, the food keeps bringing us back. I also appreciate the generous pot of Jasmine rice and the fantastic prices!"
"2","They were very accommodating!  Felt safe there.  They showed about sterilizing & options for your experience.  As a traveler this is very important to me."
"1","So here's the story on Rare. I was on the phone in the parking lot finishing with a call for about five minutes before going in the restaurant. So we walked in and were immediately escorted to our table. The server greeted us a few minutes later. Normal, right? We were sat at a table where the light from the parking lot was shining right in my face. We asked to move and the server asked the bus person to clear a table. Yet it was then we realized there were four dirty tables that had not been cleared from prior guests. While waiting to be moved to our table we ended up overhearing a conversation at another table where the lady stated that her steak had to be sent back three times. A quick glance at each other an we were up and out. \nBut didn't get to the door until were approached by the manager offering us free drinks and appetizer. Which would have been just fine until the server came up and expressed his opinion in a sarcastic tone. \""Why are you leaving? You just got here. Nothing could possibly be wrong.\"" We expressed our concern about the dirty tables and he stated that the parties had just left a minute before we got there. Since we were sitting in the parking lot we knew that was not the case. \nBad server. Bad experience."
"2","Solo Cafe is like The Usual Suspects.  Great, memorable scenes, sharp dialogue flying about, and a remarkable cast.  And a soundtrack that fits naturally with its environment.\n\nSlinging the lattes and mochas are a few gents not new to making an awesome cup (or glass) of java and if they are, you'd never know because the drinks are not only delicious every time, but consistent from whoever makes them.  \n\nWhether or not you stumble upon Solo for the 1st time or go in there knowing it well, you will enjoy the laid back atmosphere, the great service, and delicious beverages.  Not to mention unlike other cafes, this one is open late (for coffee hours that is...) \n\nSo go in, get an iced cafe mocha with soy milk (my personal fave) and skip the Bucks that's overpriced and impersonal.  Support the \""little guy\"".  You'll feel sooo much better slurping on the caffeine that way."
"2","Ummm...wine.  Well, the wine list is surprisingly short, but the food was really delicious and the ambiance is great.  An unusually large patio area, which is lovely and clean and perfectly lit.  I went inside because I was dining alone this night (insert violin strings here) and the inside was also a great experience.  It is a converted garage and they left the garage doors to the street open on this mild early spring night.  It is clean and modern and zen-like.  As expected on a Monday at 8:00 pm, it was pretty slow, although there were several groups on the patio.  The bartender was also my waitress, and she was pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu.  I ordered a glass of pinot noir for $8, which was decent, a brussel sprouts salad (from which I asked them to remove the pancetta in a fit of caloric guilt), and an entree of plank grilled salmon with a side of kale and a mushroom couscous.  All of the food was awesome.  I took half of it to go and had a great lunch the next day because it was quite a bit of food for one person.  The couscous was so delicious that I am certain it must have been horribly fattening.  The salmon was perfectly cooked and the kale was just garlicky enough without being overpowering.  I will be going back and dragging friends next time, hopefully a little earlier in the evening to catch the energy that I am sure this atmosphere is sure to generate.  And to sit on the patio.  The wine list is very limited but the one I tried was very very good."
"2","One of my favorite local eateries. The mild & wild sauce is my absolute favorite, I wish I could purchase it. I am not a big bar food junkie but the tomlin sandwich is great & reminds me of a fatheads sandwich. Food portion is great. The only complaint I would have if any is the craft beer is a little on the pricey side, as usual in most local bars. Friendly service, will continue to frequent with my family."
"2","One of the best Thai's food place I have eaten in a long time. I live in OC with many good Thai restaurant but this is better than all the one in OC.  Drunken Noodle was eaten by my HIGH MAITENANCE friend and she loved it. She said best Drunken Noodle she ever had.  Parking lot and outside restaurant looks like a whole in the wall place but food makes up for it.  A block from Strastosphere."
"2","The sandwich I ordered was too hot, but that was my fault. The green chiles and the pepperjack cheese and the spicy mayo made my turkey sandwich into a Mexican fiesta. The sourdough was thick cut and the turkey was top quality, so if I can just order the cranberry concoction next time then everything will work out great. They include a bag of chips with food, so not inclined to try the salads, but next time will pull the trigger on a cookie."
"2","Simply exceptional. Good food, great quality, great service. Great atmosphere - very relaxed and quiet. Good place to think or have a chat with spouse or friend."
"2","Food was outstanding! One of the best buffets in the area. Waiters was very nice and kept our drinks full the entire time. Do not know if they do military discounts."
"1","Not quite sure how the sushi is but the place smells funky and we are still waiting on our sushi after 20min. The two guys behind the bar preparing it is steadily chatting with the 4 females sitting in front of them. It's very frustrating when your watching them take there time while your starving.  Also not really a fan of how you have to order"
"1","New owner don't waste ur money:("
"1","I too was seduced by the high Yelp ratings for this company.\n\nI will keep this simple:\n\nIf you want to pay three times what you should due to the incompetence and greed of a company, then these are your guys."
"2","its located inside circus circus on the las vegas strip. Its small but it does the job. prices are average Krispy Cream prices. The doughnuts were fresh and there was a good selection of them already made. Who knew it was located inside the casino. my addiction to doughnuts lead me here :)"
"2","holy shoepruewiruweprweprj ! world class pastry's and dessert right here !!! best ive ever had !!! i have the tuttie frutti and cup cakes and triple chocalate mouseee man costed me over 25 dollars but you pay for what you get!!"
"2","Nice new place.  Counter has about 8 seats and looks as if a counter will be put in the window for about 6 more seats.  Had a few people in front of us waiting for there take out orders and a few at the counter.  You order and they then cook your order.   It took 11 minutes from when we ordered. \n\nThe food is good.  Went with the Chicago Dog which was a killer.  Have been craving one for a while since my favorite Dog shop closed last year.  The Mac and Cheese comes with the long spiral noodles and is pretty good.\n\nHas been a while since I have been to the Library location, so will have to return and got one of the build your own burgers.\n\nfacebook;https://www.facebook.com/BurgerzNDogz"
"1","I would give this place zero stars if I could. The service was terrible for a football Sunday when there really wasn't that many people there. Just another overpriced bar in old town with nothing special to offer. They also overcharged for my food but we didn't feel like waiting around for it to be changed on the bill. Back to my dive bar!!"
"2","\""Wow, you wouldn't have known that we're inside the Hooters Hotel.\"" --My friend Khathy H. said this about the establishment. \n\nWith that being said, this place is pretty nice looking.  The menu options have some Vegas related names/spins. Overall, the place is a no-hassle, simple, affordable, American food restaurant.  \n\nWhat did I order? The American something on the breakfast menu. For around $8 I got four slices of toast, 4 sausage links, two eggs & some country style potatoes. Was it good? Yup. Would I recommend this place? Yeah!"
"1","All the Pho restaurant here in Vegas is about the same...but the service at the place just makes it bad. The staff is rude...don't greet you...they just seem like they don't want to be there...so why would you? The place is dim/ depressing and dirty. If your a Pho connoisseur and see sauces and gack splatter on the wall you know this place is dirty. It's just un-appetizing.  If they don't care what the dinning area looks like ...just wonder what happens in the kitchen. Not worth giving it a second try."
"2","Well ladies, its just a necessary appointment to make when someone other than yourself is in that area...you know what i mean. I like the pretty kitty because they can always get me in the same day, the technicians are so quick with removal its only awkward for a moment and every time i have a nice conversation with the trained staff. \nalso one of the main reasons i prefer PK is because its actually pretty inside\n\nso go!"
"2","Another one of my top 5 casinos.  This place literally smells like roses!  Like freaking roses, people!\n\nSorry, I had to get that out of my system.  \n\nA very large casino with plenty of touristy, sight-seeing things here.  A Sistine-ish ceiling, opera singers, a giant mall, tons of restaurants, gondoliers.  What more could you possibly want?\n\nNow that I'm a local, I come here more for the people-watching aspect.  I realize now I can't afford the shops at the mall, or the restaurants, or the ride in a gondola.... But it's still fun to just hang out.  And smell the roses.\n\nIn all, an architecturally beautiful building that you can wander in for hours.  Minimal smoke smell.  A couple permanent shows and a venue for rotating singers and comedians.  You can find a few restaurants that are moderately priced (about $15 per entree, Grand Lux for example) and there is a food court in the mall near the parking garage.\n\nLocated on the north side of the strip, connected to the Palazzo and near Mirage, Treasure Island, Wynn/Encore, and Harrah's.  A bit of a walk to the other casinos.  It can get really crowded on the weekends.\n\nI had stayed in a room about 5 years ago and they were large and beautiful.  Very romantic if that's what you are going for.  All their rooms are suites."
"1","SKIP THE DOGS! They're HORRIBLE! I mean, TERRIBLE! The chili was definitely delicious, so if you're really stuck on going here, grab the chili cheese fries and please save yourself the money and skip the dog. I've never been so adamant on telling someone to skip something as I am about this! The bun was stale, the dog itself was bad- it had that POP when you take your first bite, and though I know that is the goal of some places that serve dogs, I know that's not the goal for pinks and I'm pretty sure it poped because it was way overly old and over cooked. I'm sad to have to give a place with such a great reputation in LA such a bad review, but clearly they sold themselves out when coming to Vegas and just got dollar signs in their eyes without making sure the quality followed with them. I seriously have had MUCH BETTER hot dogs at the movie theater. I couldn't even finish my over-priced hot dog because it was THAT BAD. I know I sound like a snob, but I'm not, i promise. I was hungry after having a long day of walking and beers and all I wanted was a delicious juicy hot dog and this was very disappointing. I keep going on but it was that bad. Good luck to you if you ignore this and still get a dog, I pray I just caught them on a really really off and bad day, but from what I understand, I'm not too far off from what others were saying.Sorry friends!"
"2","Best bar food in all of AZ! The Nacho & Hummus platters are so good & the burgers are big and juicy. In fact all the food is delicious, can't go wrong. The beers are as everyone knows are fantastic. My fav being the 8th street but their hef is really great on a hot day. The Patio is real nice with the sprinkler system and if there is a game on you can get the outside feel and still watch their big flat screen without dealing with glare. \n\nLate night, 4peaks turns into a bar for the hipster ASU crowd but is still a good time. Enjoy"
"1","Definitely a fun scene. Girls in bikinis, nice weather, great club music with better and better dj's every time. Here's my problem.. I got a cabana for a group of friends. I was told $650 minimum which wasn't a problem..the menu said a bottle of Grey Goose was $325 so I told our gorgeous server that two bottles would do it. Many drinks and dances later, long after \""scottsdale delirium\"" had set in, I am presented with a bill for over $900 and added a gratuity making it over a grand. On the bill it said a bottle of goose was over $400.. I wasn't sure what was going on and not wanting to make a scene after a fun day, I signed and left with a bitter taste in my mouth.. It's a good club in a great area but since when is treating a repeat VIP/cabana customer like that a good idea??"
"2","I had Luke's last night and must say it was pretty good. Being from Chicago I always frequent places in the valley that advertise being a Chicago Style. This place can say it is a Chicago Style. \n\nDripping Beef Sandwiches, Polish Sausages and homemade peppers pretty much makes up the menu and that is what makes it Chicago Style. A simple menu with good meat and peppers on it. It has a hole in the wall authentic feel but it is a very clean place. \n\nI would definitely eat here again for a good beef sandwich with Mozzarella."
"1","I use to love Direct tv when I first got it but now I'm counting the days for my contract to be over. It always freezes, all my boxes. I've reset the boxes per customer service advice. It doesn't work. The freezing is getting so bad that it's last for over a minute. Even worse, we've now been getting doubled billed each month. We're told it depends if we pay with credit card or debit card (online). We pay differently each month thus causing the system to double bill us. C/S was on phone with me for over an hour scratching their heads on how to fix the problem. End result... they said they'll keep an eye on our account!?!?!  I will not renew my lease & cannot recommend direct tv."
"2","I try to go \""independent\"" with many things; I try avoid chains restaurants and stores as much as possible, but PetSmart's grooming services at this location were one of the best in Pittsburgh. The staff was amazing with my dog who can get a bit nervous when people touch his feet. They were calm, understanding, and made sure my dog was comfortable. Unlike other local locations, they had no problem with him and did not use a muzzle. \nI did not purchase anything from the store itself, but I will continue to use their grooming services."
"2","What a great store. While I've browsed here countless times and have always enjoyed perusing the massive variety of eclectic items, it wasn't until last week that I actually made a purchase. \n\n+ Super helpful staff - very knowledgable, patient, and friendly. \n+ Reasonable pricing\n+ Huge variety of things; it's almost overwhelming\n+ Prompt check-out\n+ Great packaging\n\nI say the place is almost overwhelming because while I spent well over an hour searching through the store before confidently selecting my item, as I was walking out, I spied 2 new things I missed, and wish I would've bought... looks like I'll be back."
"1","Food was just average.  Crab cake sliders were blah.  Husband had the club sandwich, it was pretty good."
"2","Stopped in here for some of their bakery goods.  The taro bun cake and the chocolate bun cake are very fresh and really good.  There is just a bit of pastry creme inside.  I don't usually do the shopping, but I enjoy strolling through the isles looking over the goods.  I love Asian markets and enjoy discovering new things. I usually have to ask my husband what it is and what it's used in, and often find it intriguing.\n\nThis store appears clean, smells aren't too bad, and the prices are pretty good!"
"1","Ruby's Dinette is the alternative to Ruby's Diner for those who want their airport food on the go.  I assumed this would be a good choice for breakfast since this tends to be the strong point of diners nationwide.  But being located at an airport, sure enough I would be wrong.  I opted for a breakfast burrito which came in at over $9 after tax.  All meals are made to order, so I waited over at the pickup counter for the short order cook to make my meal.  \n\nWhat I got was a flat brick bedecked with a tub of sour cream.  Brick is an apt description, covering the rectangular cross section and its general heft.  If I were to drop this thing, it would have resounded with a strong thud.  The wrap was bland.  Inside, there was a solid mound of egg and an incredible amount of cheddar cheese.  I also picked up the taste of fresh tomatoes, but it was so hard to tell.  The cheese just dominated the flavor entirely, to the point where I could not even taste the eggs.  It was a regrettable choice, and I had difficulty finishing it.  If you are interested in paying a premium price for really salty, fatty food, then this place is a must visit on your next trip to Las Vegas.  For everyone else, just skip by the neon lights as you will be surely disappointed otherwise."
"1","Ok, maybe it's just me, but the sign outside said lunch ends at 2:30 and dinner starts at 2:31....hmmmm. This is not Buger King...but seems they may be a bit inflexible. \n\nI came specifically looking for a good Italian sub, but was there at 2:55. Really, a cold cut sandwich could not be made 25 minutes past the deadline. Really? Absolutely not, (part of the company policy I'm guessing), the young man gave a flat no...end of subject. C'mon, pretend to go back and see if there's any salami left. Nope...no is no.\n\nAnyway, got the cannelloni, arrived quickly and hot. It was edible, but like a high school cooking class meal. Olive Gardens is way better.\n\nAnyway, it's clean, staff ok,  price ok, but was disappointed in both the food and the unwillingness to accommodate what seems like a very minor variation.\n\nTake note Sicilian Ristorante, inflexibility is not an appealing characteristic of a restaurant."
"2","I love Tropical Smoothie! My personal favs are promegrante plunge, acai berry boost, kiwi quencher. I also order king caesar wrap, salsa sunrise wrap and early bird junior. When I'm pressed for time I usually call to place my oder and it's wonderful to know that when I come to pick up that they know me by my name! \n\nPerfect place for healthy alternative!"
"2","I never write reviews, but I have to recommend the Renaissance! The staff was ABSOLUTELY wonderful! I was traveling for business so I hardly had any down-time at the hotel... but I had a lovely, clean room with a nice bathroom. The parking garage across the street was very convenient and reasonably priced.\n\nWhen I checked out, I accidentally left my cell phone charger plugged into the wall and my raincoat in the closet (clearly I was in a hurry in the morning and not very careful!) I called the hotel that night and they were very nice and said someone from Housekeeping would get back to me the next day. Someone from housekeeping called me the next morning and she was so sweet. They mailed me both items for no charge (I offered to give them a credit card, but they said no.) I receive the package within 3 days of returning from my stay. They truly went above and beyond! I'd definitely recommend staying there."
"1","Sorry but this place is a clutter filled mess with a strange stench in the air.  I gave the Coffee Cove a try last year and it is one of the strangest businesses I have ever been in.   The tables and chairs are mish mashed and not in a good way.  There is junk all over the shop.  It looks like an episode of Hoarders!  There was a gross smell inside which other reviewers said was mold.  I'm not sure as I never smelled mold before but based on the dirtiness of this place mold would be a good guess.  My drink had way to much milk in it.  I won't be back.  It's sad because this area does not have many independent coffee shops and I HATE Starbucks.  I wanted to find another local coffee shop, but sadly this place missed on all levels."
"1","These guys are waayyyy slow!  The prices are.... reasonable I guess?  But in brevity, my experiences below:\n\nMeat- Middle of the road quality, but pricing can be a bit extreme.  Caution with meat that is priced \""special\"" as it can be as old as I am from time to time.  The butchers are incredibly friendly and helpful though.  Great Carne Asada.\n\nProduce- I haven't had too many experiences with bad produce, but prices are a bit ridiculous.  They have a decent variety, but sometimes stocking levels are horribly low.\n\nGrocery- The Just For You is about the only way they are consistently budget friendly.  They tend to pull the age old trick of knocking down the most expensive brand a few cents when generics or lesser brands are as much as half of the price.\n\nCleanliness- Biggest knock.  At any given time you can find half of their staff sitting on the tables out front smoking, meanwhile lines are extremely long.  GO UNION!!  I shop at Glaziers primarily for this reason."
"2","I live in Southern Highlands and I don't mind traveling over to iFocus for my eye examination because Dr. Velasco and her staff are friendly and wonderful people. She is a wonderful eye doctor  and she always remembers her patients and she must have a lot of them! The coupons on Yelp or Groupon definitely make the cost of the examination and glasses less expensive and you can always use them to get a second pair of glasses or a prescription sunglasses.\n\nI'm getting to that age where I have presbyopia and am nearsighted, so finding the correct prescription is difficult. Last year in Los Angeles I went to LensCrafters in the Fox Hills Mall and it was a nightmare (not to mention hour long wait times). Every time I went, I had a new doctor. They would experiment with my prescription and I felt like a guinea pig. It took them 2 months to get a decent pair of glasses and contacts (at one point, they even lost my records and I had to repeat the whole lengthy examination all over again). The first pair of progressive glasses I got from them gave me optical migraines, I had to send them back and get mono-vision ones and separate reading glasses. \n\nDr Velasco was able to fit me with the correct pair of progressive lenses in one sitting. I no longer get the headaches. The multi-focal contact lenses are a little tricky (since I have an astigmatism in one eye) and we are still working on it. She doesn't mind repeated fittings and is most kind. I think the technology on these type of lenses is just not perfected yet.\n\nThe selection of frames is not as large as some of the other eyeglass stores, but you can always get your eyes checked with Dr. Velasco and take your prescription elsewhere, the folks at iFocus don't mind.\n\nSo next time you need to get your eyes checked or require a pair of glasses, get the Yelp coupon here or go search Groupon to get a discount and come to iFocus!"
"2","I would have to agree with the first reviewer! I haven't been summoned in 18 months and my have things changed since! Jury duty was in a different building this time around and I was impressed! The check in process was high tech. The gathering room was HUGE and clean with big screen TVs all over. It reminded me of a very clean airport. I didn't get a chance to wander into all the bells and whistles they had to offer, such as the cafeteria or the quiet room, but it has definitely changed my outlook for the next summons."
"2","Used to love this place. The pep pep and captains order were very good. I guess the owner decided to part ways and works for a casino on the strip now. After that I guess they started going down hill. It's a bummer their restaurant on Durango closed"
"1","This place is falling apart. Literally... The huge disco ball fell from the ceiling as we were watching a concert. The bathrooms are disgusting and everything needs a good cleaning. With that said it's a nice small venue to see a band, with great acoustics!\n\nWe did not eat or drink downstairs so I cannot comment about that."
"2","Four Stars?  Why?  Because it was $200 cheaper than everyone else and there was no line at check-in.\n\nThe check-in experience was an issue.\n\nAttendant :  \""Gas is cheaper in Arizona than Nevada, just so you know.\""\nMe:  \""Thanks\""\nThe above conversation was me agreeing to their gas fill-up service.\n\nAttendant:  \""Are you going to Sedona?\""\nMe: \""Yes\""\nAttendant \""You will need a bigger engine for those mountains, let me see if i can upgrade you.\""\nme:  \""Wow, Thank you, sir.\""\nThe above conversation was me agreeing to $297 additional for a luxury car.\n\nWhen I was handed the keys and looked at the receipt, I about blew my top.  After giving him an earful and breaking his spirit, i got the full-size car i wanted for 7 days for $195.  Beware of check-in.\n\nOh yeah, and make sure you document every scratch on the car on the little picture provided."
"2","Without a doubt Alphabet is the coolest video shop I have ever been in. Somehow this tiny shop has managed to squeeze in two floors of DVDs and videos scaling from floor to ceiling. Depending on what takes your fancy you could rent something from the world cinema, 1950s, crime, cartoon or Hollywood Blockbuster sections. If they don't have what you're looking for on DVD then they're only too happy to lend you a video player with scart leads etc at no extra charge. The owner of the shop (I call him Tall Face McLovely in my head) beams with pride about Alphabet and he is incredibly willing to spend the time with every customer recommending films he thinks they might enjoy. A great local shop."
"1","My family and I have been to this restaurant a few times.  We liked the fact that it is a locally owned restaurant, and the food is pretty decent.\nAfter what happened tonight, I would rather throw my money in the trash than give it to the owners of this restaurant.\nI took my children to an early dinner.  When we arrived, there were two other couples in the place, and they both already had their dinners.  We ordered dinner - a french toast meal, a bacon hamburger with soup (instead of fries), and Eggs Benedict with no muffins and eggs over-hard.  \nWhen the meals came...the french toast was the only thing right.  The hamburger came with fries, no soup.  Easily fixed.  My meal came with eggs runny as anything.  I sent them back.\nWhen the waitress told the \""chef\"" that I had asked for my eggs over-hard, he complained loud enough that I heard it.  It wasn't his fault - she had forgotten to tell him.  He grudgingly made me a new meal, and sent it out.\nMy eggs were still runny.  I sent them back again.  The complaint (in Greek) that came from the kitchen was loud enough to cause the other patrons of the restaurant to take notice.\nMy eggs came back out again (by this time, my kids were almost done eating), and they had clearly been microwaved and were rubbery.\nAs I was eating my meal (no eggs....I didn't trust them, or the chef), the owner of the restaurant went into the kitchen.  The chef very loudly had a conversation with the owner, I'm assuming about me, as the owner then stared at me until I noticed him.\nAs I was getting ready to pay for the meal (which had no compensation at all for my wait time or the crappy service), I told the waitress that I would be filing a formal review on Yelp and any other site I could find.  \nDear Owner of Nicks - have some freaking professionalism.  Your attitude towards a \""difficult\"" customer is going to come back to you tenfold.  I will be telling every person I know in the Surprise area that your restaurant is unprofessional, doesn't care to help it's customers, and isn't worth their money.\nI will not ever step foot into this place again."
"1","Same experience I had with Koraku at Primm Valley. The food here was totally inedible and ridiculously pricey. Everything is double from the price at L.A but the quality is ten times worse than any Sam Woo or equivalent at L.A.  The lunch special char siu with rice was a joke. It tasted and looked like the char siu from Manchus Wok or Chinatown Express with red/purple dye penetrated down into the interior of the pork . The color of the interior was dark instead of white that a good char siu pork supposed to be. I feel sorry for the local Chinese who have to come to this place to satisfy their need for comfort food. Honestly the quality of this place cannot survive in bay area or southern California at any moment. Whoever doing the cooking in kitchen must be those unwanted from California who have to make its way to Vegas to make ends meet."
"2","Great food classy atmosphere weekday all u can eat sushi and sake special is well worth it"
"2","This might be our favorite restaurant experience of all time.  Hidden in a strip mall, Raku instantly surprises you with decor that is modern and stylish and yet reminiscent of a traditional restaurant in Japan.\n\nThe food is truly amazing here.  A mix of standard and original dishes, smartly conceived, and expertly prepared with very fresh ingredients.  Every offering is an adventure in flavor and texture.  I've often wondered what it must be like to sit at the judges' table of the original Iron Chef, but I can't imagine it's much better than having a meal at Raku.\n\nSome highlights:\n\nAgedashi Tofu: Creamy and smooth tofu delicately fried and served in a savory broth.  Loved it, and I don't even particularly like tofu.\n\nPoached egg with sea urchin and salmon roe, with okra and daikon and mushrooms and broth: So much contrast between the different ingredients, and yet it all makes for a great dish.\n\nSteamed foie gras egg custard: Heavenly.\n\nGrilled foie gras: Sinful.\n\nSashimi salad: Very fresh fish on a bed of greens, lovely dressing, crispy fried onion topping.\n\nFluffy cheesecake: Beautifully presently, wonderfully light.  A sublime finish.\n\nThe wait staff was very welcoming, friendly, responsive, and helpful.  On top of everything else, the portions are relatively large, and the prices are quite affordable for the quality of food.  My wife and I had about 9 different dishes, were totally satisfied, and made it out with a total bill under $100.\n\nVisit both restrooms.  Very pleasant and surprising.\n\nIf you're in Vegas, forgo the restaurants on the strip and visit Raku."
"2","Love the chicken sandwich. Always hot and tasty!"
"2","We were here last night, and let me tell you it was pretty fantastic. Arrived at 5:30 and was lucky to snag 2 seats at the bar for happy hour. I ordered a Hendricks up and let me tell you the blonde bartender knows how to make a martini- ice floating on top. Excellence...my bf had a Goose up and it was the same. We ordered the HH prime rib sandwiches and crab meat shooters- both awesome. It is a older crowd but for $6 premium martini and $10 HH food it was as good as it gets, especially for Summerlin- and it is less than 5 minutes away from home. Btw-the views of the strip from the dining area were pretty amazing too.We will be back!"
"2","Okay, I am addicted. Actually, I've been addicted ever since the first time they put that little chocolate covered espresso bean on top of my drink. This place is amazing. The specialty drinks are delicious, the coffee is great, and the atmosphere in this small little drive-thru is better than most big name coffee houses in town. The atmosphere has a direct connection to the staff. They are warm and friendly, and since I force my addictions on my husband, they also greet us like we're family. The Human Bean gives customers punch cards to earn free drinks and hand out dog treats to the extra special four-legged coffee connoisseur. Never before have I been so grateful for my inability to make coffee I really enjoy at home. Thank goodness they are only a short drive down the road!"
"2","Went back to Oyshi last Monday and the place was packed. A Little surprised but expected knowing this place is pretty popular. Anyway, did the AYCE again, but I ordered the Kami Kaze and NYI rolls. Word of warning, these things were HUGE. I thought the AYCE portions suppose to be smaller than the regular order. If this is smaller order, I'm afraid to ask what their regular size would be. These two rolls came out near the end of our meals and we were kinda full by that time already, so trying to stuff those two rolls down was a challenge. Next time, I won't order this roll unless I have 2 or 3 people to split it with. Anyway, the reason I reduced one star on this trip is that the sushi wasn't as fresh as my previous trip there. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't exceptional fresh either. I heard from some review, not sure if it's for Oyshi or Kobe, that it might be due to the fact that fish delivery comes on Tue, Thu and Sat."
"1","Was robbed outside at 8pm in front of the store in the parking spot closest to the doors. They took everything and bolted. \n\nLearned that this Safeway literally has no cameras outside, their camera on their front door can only capture who goes in the store, and there is no security.\n\nThanks, Safeway.\n\nAlso, they have a good bakery here, so I guess it gets two stars. \n\nCome in and have a fresh cinnamon roll after you've been robbed."
"1","My office is now with in walking distance, but we have been going here since it was Dee's. We being a couple of guys and I. So today Bruce said; lets go to lunch, I say, ok. He then says; I know anywhere except 5Th ave. The boy knows me so well ;-[) I tell him no I will go today, it has been a while since I have given in and gone with the masses. I just do not like the place. So we walk over and are greeted by a bubbly waitress. This place always has nice wait people. She talks with us for a few minutes and then takes our order. \nOh the food, the food. I order a french dip with Cole slaw and a side of onion rings. Bruce has his usual a BLT with well done bacon and fries.\nNow mind you we are the only folks ordering at the time and still it takes an unusual amount of time to get the food. Which by the way would have been better if we had never gotten our food. What I get is roast beef cut thickly and with the grain. Now anyone who likes a french dip knows the meat should be supple and sliced thinly, piled nicely on the bun. It should also have a rich beef flavour as should the au jus. I mean even the lowly of the low line cook should know one slices meat against the grain, always. The bun on which it sat was just that, a meat seat. I also love Cole slaw and usually will eat what is served, not this. Totally lacking any inspiration resulting in no flavour. The rings looked good, but looks can be deceiving.\nSo Bruce you are right, any place but 5Th ave."
"2","I made a special trip to try out this place.  In fact I decided to try out the light rail on the same day and road it from Mesa to downtown Phoenix specifically to eat at the Hero Factory.  I loved it.   When you've got great bread and Boar's Head brand meat you can never go wrong.  Luckily I had a long ride back to Mesa on the Rail so I could wallow in my gluttony after a foot long, side salad, large cookie and a large soda.  I was comfortably miserable.  Best sandwich I've had in this town so far."
"2","To eat here you must love coal brick-oven pizza, sliced mozarella, fresh sauce and thin crust. If you do, you'll like the pizza at Grimaldi's.  Although I lack experience with true NY style pizza, I must say that if this represents a small percentage of it, I'm down for some NY love.  \n\nGrimaldi's is all about the oven, the crust, and the fresh ingredients.  When I saw the 3.5 star rating two weeks ago I realized that I had to eat the pizza to find out for myself.  Mind you, all of us have different tastes when it comes to pizza, each person wanting a certain stretch to the dough or sweetness to the sauce.  I personally love sweeter sauce, but at Grimaldi's it's more tangy.  I personally love shredded cheese but here it's sliced fresh mozzarella.  I needed to try something different, so I went for the personal with basil.\n\nIt took ten minutes to complete my pizza, not long at all.  When I received the box I sort of freaked out at the size.  I'm used to the pizza hut sizes, where personal means that small round personal pan pizza.  Their version of personal reminds me of a medium, or something very close to that.  The crust is super thin, slightly crispy especially on the edges, and the ingredients are layered nicely on top.  It was interesting to see the sauce exposed between the slices of cheese, and crispy basil on top.  I hopped into my car, turned on the a/c, and peeled a slice from the box.\n\nWow.  This pizza is yummy.  I'm not going to go so far as to say something fabulous, amazing, or even orgasmic, but I love this pizza.  At the point it's slightly soggy from the sauce, but still holds up while you eat it.  It's one of those pizzas I recommend folding the sides in a bit while holding it to eat it properly.  My husband hates crust and he ate the whole pizza--crust and all.  I love the tangy fresh tomato sauce, the mozzarella that stretches beautifully when bitten in to, and I go for basil in the oven rather than after because it gets sweeter and has that crispy texture to it.  Yum.\n\nAfter the first time there I went back two days later for the same order.  Then two days after that.  Oh and then three days from that day, and then four days ago and the day before yesterday.  Yeah.  I like it that much. I always order the same thing--personal with basil--because I don't want to ruin the flavors of the other ingredients and the crust.  I love the taste of the dough on this pizza--slightly sweet, almost a hint of sourdough-ness, and you can taste the char a bit.  \n\nRemember, we all have different tastes, and many aren't in to this type of pizza.  For me, it's the only pizza I'll eat till I find another great NY pizza joint in town.  The other downfall of this place are the prices.  Many wouldn't pay $9 for a personal size and then pay $2-$5 dollars per additional topping.  The small is $13, for example, so many get turned off by the price.  Still, it's a great pizza joint that I've yet to eat in at because I love the idea of getting a pizza in a box.  It's just this weird thing I have with pizza.\n\nYou should try Grimaldi's if you haven't yet.  It's not your typical pizza delivery crap, but something ten times better.  I like it, and I hope that your taste in pizza matches this place, too."
"1","Zero stars if I could. Been going to this location since it opened and the quality and service has done nothing but go down hill. Bought the groupon last month. The wash was not even busy and it took them 48 minutes to wash my truck. My truck sat in the sun and dried while other vehicles moved through the line. When my truck came out of the wash tunnel it happened to get out in the line that was held up because another truck was getting extra detail work because it was going into the garage for a wax. So my truck and another car sat in the sun and dried! Managers excuse \""we are training new people\"". Won't be back even"
"1","We went to Fogo De Chao after hearing so many good things about it. I will tell you our good and bad. The good...\n1.) Excellent Service\n2.) My 5 year old was free and 10 year old was half off\n3.) Ok food\n\nthe Bad..\n1.) Our server who we became friendly with must have gotten off somewhere around midpoint of our dinner and vanished forever. i understand they work as a team but it was strange.\n\n2.) The salad bar was ok but other than the mozerella balls and chicken salad nothing to sing about.\n\n3.) The meat all tasted the same. The gouchos are a little boderline rude even to a 5 year old who is clearly confused why there is 8 men stickings swords of meat in his face. Calm down a little please.\n\n4.) At almost $50 a person before drinks and dessert Ruth Chris is a MUCH BETTER OTION!\n\n5.) Even with the kids being pretty much free it was still $300 for 3 adults. We all had one soda and shared three desserts between the table.  We left there kind of puzzled like well we might go back for lunch maybe but I don't know.\n6.) I wanted to buy  a mozerella ball to take home to my nanny. I was willing to pay $15 or $20 for on little ball and they wouldn't sell it to me. Now come on people we just spent $300 on dinner throw me a bone. \nOverall Not the experience we were hoping for but not the worst place I have ever eaten."
"1","No just no. The food was way below PAR I ordered the chicken enchiladas thinking it should be a delightful one..It was a big fat NO! Chicken was not cooked and the sauce was so bland I wanted to slap myself for coming to this place. A big let down to cheap and easy mexican food.."
"1","Teriyaki chicken sux \n\nSpicy ramen = instant noodles standard\n\nMy friends like to come here and I seriously dunno y...."
"2","This place is seriously awesome. I'm a BBQ lover and I'm pretty critical of BBQ places. (I'm sure I have a few reviews complaining about bad BBQ lol). However, with this place, I tried long and hard to find something they could improve and couldn't find it. The brisket is amazing, probably the best brisket you can get at a restaurant in Arizona. Seriously, go try this place now because it's going to be on the Food Network someday and you can then brag to your friends that you've already been there. It's pretty busy, so be ready for a line. Also, be careful not to get there too late, because they sell out just about every day. Just do it, it's worth the wait. Trust me! Try the brisket if it's available. However, I've heard everything is good there. I honestly can't wait to find time to go back and try something else!"
"1","I have not been to this restaurant in over a year. I was somewhat excited to have an late lunch/early dinner of Italian today so I decided to give it another try.  The service was awesome. I was the first to request to dine outside and they quickly accommodated and provided attentive service.  I started with the appetizer of baked stuffed mushrooms that are stuffed with goat cheese, spinach and spicy Italian sausage.($8)  Tasty and I'm told popular, however I was not impressed and would never recommend them. Something about that spicy just didn't click for me though I like spicy food, I just felt it was not a good paring with the smooth mild goat cheese and mushroom.  Still it was the best thing I would eat at this experience. I ordered a Caesar salad ($3) - over priced should be free. A small handful of bitter romaine lettuce and a drizzle of Caesar dressing 3 or 4 croutons with a generous portion of cheese in a small bowl.  So bad it took three croutons to get the fork-full of lettuce down. The server was kind enough to remove it from the bill.  \n\nMy entr\u00e9e was to be Carbonaro ($13). I have had it at other restaurants and loved it. I have made it and served it to a number of people and they loved it. Never have I seen or even heard of a pouched egg served on this dish, as I was assured it must have to be Carbonaro. So I tried it. Noodles are some kind of pasta I never heard of but it's served hard and I mean about 3x harder than el dente' .  Sauce was not creamy and did not coat the noodles or the crisp ham in this case. sauce was tasteless. I tried about 3 bites but once asked I had to admit I didn't care for it. My server admitted it was quite different and agreed to bring me another entr\u00e9e.   So I went with the Chicken Malino ($12).  Roasted chicken, bow-tie pasta, creamy garlic sauce, mushrooms & sun-dried tomatoes.   Served in a large bowl. A generous portion  about 2 servings actually.  \nIt was better or as I told the server more palatable.  I ate half of it took the rest to go but feed it to my dog what does she know about good Italian anyway?\n\n\nRuby (my dog) says:\n\""Andiamo! Sono un cane-io non so nemmeno il cibo \u00e8 italiano!\""\n\nAnyway as I thought about the food after trying 2 entr\u00e9es I came to the this conclusion. The building, the tablecloths, the interior and even the patio are what this restaurant chain sells well.  It makes ones visit memorable.  It's the setting for a nice date or to bring out of town guest to, to socialize of  wines and to break bread together.  It's the backdrop to some nice dining photos as well.  It's moderately priced yet over priced after all it's mostly pasta and lettuce you're getting.  But when it comes to the food, they pretty much threw together ingredients that would sound or appear in print to be appealing.  It's a simple menu that doesn't take much talent or time to prepare.  It's really rather awful food placed in a beautiful setting. How anyone who can cook Italian or has ever been to one of the many little Italy communities in America or Canada can really say they love the food here is beyond my ability to believe or comprehend.  So if you go drink lots of wine and maybe you'll forget that the food is lousy you are buying.  But hopefully the staff will be attentive and keep your glasses full.  And maybe you'll get a few nice photos on your phone.  Oh and none of the food looks like it does in the pictures added to this review site! I knew I should have took pictures of something while there.  My meal plus ice tea ($2.50)  Was $24.51.  NOT a cheap date for my book.  Multiple that by 2 or more and add wine or other drinks and you'll scratch your head and ask yourself  \"" For this I paid what?  And I'm hungry in 2 hours!\""  \nI gotta go I'm sure there's something in my home fridge that will hold me over until my next meal!"
"2","This was my second visit, but my first time trying the food. Great happy hour deal with half off starters. We tried several and they were all delicious. Especially the short rib tacos. We were here for a birthday and used a back room to gather. Lots of fun. Nice atmosphere. Very friendly staff."
"2","Great phone service. Promised delivery time. Cool delivery dude. CRAZY good food.   I will be eating here again very soon."
"2","Tasty burgers and a great happy hour. Where else can you go for dollar drinks on the strip? Go see Daizee, she knows how to move fast while providing some tasty beverages of the alcoholic persuasion! Make sure to get there early, it can get pretty busy being such a popular place :)"
"1","During graveyard shift I stopped in for a cup of Joe and a bite to eat. The cashier was absolutely the worst person I've ever encountered at a Starbucks. She just looked at me with death in her eyes until I asked her if I could order something.  She was not delighted that she had to get out of her chair to heat up my sandwich.  She limps over to the toaster puts my food in then proceeds to throw away trash using her bare hands to push it down. Gets better...after handling the trash she doesn't wash her hands and uses them to take my food out of the oven!! Wtf! Then she tosses my food on the counter and says \""there ya go\"". ..um hello did I break your ankle? How about taking the night off so you don't ruin other people's!"
"2","My father, who had Alzheimer's disease and dementia, was a resident at Huger Mercy Living Center for the past six years.  Our expectations for high-quality care were exceeded in every respect.  Some specific examples are given below.\n\n* Beautiful, safe grounds with a large flower garden and unending walking paths; sheltered patios for sitting outside in front of the four cottages\n* Well trained, competent, caregivers who receive ongoing professional training\n* Caregivers had extra patience and skills with residents when challenging situations arose\n* Staff who supported residents' faith, beliefs, and values\n* The care provided was based on the latest research about Alzheimer's disease and dementia; for example, music  as part of the activities and appropriate colors in the cottages\n* The meals and snacks were nutritious, varied and delicious\n* Variety of activities and outings to entertain the residents; themed parties, refreshments after Chapel services\n* Communication with families was consistently excellent\n* Families and friends can visit ANYTIME and expect consistent high-quality care\n* Speakers with expertise on topics that were relevant and of interest to families were provided\n* Monthly newsletter was sent to families with pictures of their Loved Ones\n* Staff managed the final days of life with respect and compassion\n* The staff worked well together as a team to care for the residents and their families\n\nWe cannot imagine better care than Huger Mercy Living Center provided.  \nWe recommend it to others without reservations."
"2","Today was the first time ordering from this place and let me tell you....the food was very YUMMY!!!!!!!!"
"2","When Joey nearly DIED (not at all, just had a tiny allergic reaction) and was in horrendous PAIN (not even a little, i don't even think she noticed) and her face blew up like a massive BALLOON (it was a little swollen) and I was pretty sure she wasn't gonna make it - that part's true...\n\nSo basically when I was having a nervous breakdown because I thought my favorite person/dog in the world was having a fatal plague-like attack they took care of her and barely laughed at me for being a crazy person. \n\nI love the VN who is in on the weekends, and I take Jo and they love her like I love her. Ok, a little less crazy, freaky over-protective mama bear love... but they take good care of her."
"2","Great service, great food, great everything! Chef was very helpful and kind. Place has a nice vibe."
"1","Consistency, Consistency, Consistency...  As a former employee and frequent guest, it pains me to give such a mediocre review. I ordered the SEARED AHI TUNA AND HUMMUS appetizer. When it came to the table I instantly noticed a problem; No sesame seed crust. I didn't think much of it until I got a third of the way through and realized the advertised SEARED ahi was in fact WELL DONE! :( :( I paused eating and drinking until a my server came back outside. \n\nI explained the situation and told her I didn't want a remake but would like some kind of recovery for eating a completely botched order. Not even a manager came out to talk to me. \n\nAs a former employee of another Pita Jungle, it pains me to make a comment but the fact NOTHING was done to recover my experience. I will definitely ponder which location I go to to enjoy my once favorite dish. \n\nMy server Nicole was great, I just really\nhope she brought my situation up to a manager or kitchen manager and it was the managers fault in not recovering my experience.\n\nWill go back to the Scottsdale location, with caution... and next time\nI will have NO hesitation sending it back! Being in the industry has it's double edge sword of service and dining etiquette."
"2","OK OK...warning, before you read this, I AM NOT A MAJOR GAMBLER. OK, phew...with that being said, I HAD A BLAST AT AT THIS CASINO!! I actually played blackjack here, which probably doesn't mean much to some, but I'm notorious for playing penny slots (all day, b/c I'm a \""baller\"") but I actually played blackjack for several hours here. The dealers play two roles, dealer and entertainer. At this casino, you will see dealers that impersonate Tina Turner, Rick James, Zac Brown, Janet Jackson, Beyonce, Shakira...the list goes on and on. My favorite dealer was Zac Brown...he was just so much fun, so energetic, and really entertained our table (all of us were friends at the table) for hours! We had so much fun that we went back here every day of our trip (we were there for four days) but the Saturday/Sunday dealers were a lot more fun than the Monday/Tuesday ones...prob because the Casino was less crowded during the regular weekday.\n\nWhile we didn't win big, we didn't lose either...which is always a perk! If you're interested in a laid back, CASUAL environment (think t-shirt and shorts) while you play blackjack and listen to your dealers perform their big hits, this is the place for you. Good luck...mama needs a new pair of shoes!!"
"1","I like Rubio's in general, but this location is pretty hit or miss on the food quality and service.  I prefer the one on the other side of the I-10 next to the movie theater."
"1","I absolutely love pad thai in general- and HATED it here.  I tried to make it better by mixing in some spicy sauce, but that didn't work at all.\n\nMy boyfriend a had a curry dish that he enjoyed.\n\nI'd be willing to go back and update my rating if my new dish was tastier and I definitely wouldn't order the pad thai."
"2","If you haven't eaten at noca yet, you don't know what fine dining is."
"2","I'm definitely a fan of this quick eatery. If you're in the mood for some quick and reasonably priced Mediterranean food ZiKiZ is a good option. It's like a Subway for Mediterranean food, but better because it's not Subway. You won't regret giving them a try."
"1","There is such a thing as being too attentive, and Pho Van's service is too much and a bit suffocating. Other than their overpriced menu, the dipping sauce for the spring rolls is too salty, made purely of Hoison sauce. The egg noodle soup is decent, but contains too much dried shrimp in the broth."
"2","We've got loads of Indian takeaways nearer to us than this, but we always go here. It's worth the trip. The food is great, what more do you need to know?\nOh all right, the chicken puri is excellent - it's a starter, but if you don't have a huge appetite it's a big enough portion to qualify as a main. I like their lamb Bhuna, spicy enough to have a kick without making your eyes water, and nice tender chunks of lamb."
"2","First and foremost it's about time a gay nightclub opened up in a casino on the strip! \nThe club is beautiful! The gold and black decor give it a very luxurious and classy feel which makes it unique compared to other gay nightclubs in Vegas! The staff is very friendly and also very very good looking! \nDrinks are very reasonably priced considering the location on the strip and the DJs sure know how to keep people on the dance floor! \nMy friends and I had an amazing time and can't wait to go back!"
"1","Prices are on the high side, for the quality of food.  I had what essentially was spaghetti with meatballs, and it was not that good.  The meatballs were super dense.  The sauce was too salty and greasy.  I think the pasta was whole wheat spaghetti, which i didn't mind, but I could see some people not liking the texture as compared to regular spaghetti.  My husband had a roast beef sandwich with french fries, which seemed ok.  The server brought the food without bringing any utensils, then went off for several minutes and served another table while we were sitting around waiting with food in front of us.  Kind of awkward.  A plus is the open feel of the place, plenty of seating, especially the outdoors balcony seating has a great view."
"2","I just got my dog from the Arizona Humane Society and they suggested VCA. I was very happy with the care they gave Coco, and the time they spent with her. Someone who has had a dog for quite some time suggested that maybe they were trying to suggest too many tests and meds for me to \""buy\"" that weren't necessary but I don't know that to be the case.  She's new to me and I don't know her history so I think it's better safe than sorry. The medicine they gave me for her ear infection perked her up immediately. I'm going to take her back there for sure."
"1","I was lured in by Groupon, to a place that appeared to have better-than-average, slightly fancy bar food and a fun ambiance... wrong on both points.  Appetizer- previously frozen stuffed jalapenos... how do I know they were previously frozen?  Because they were still frozen when they were served to us.  Caprese salad- mushy, flavorless plum tomatoes with equally bland mozzarella.  They could buy their supplies from costco and do much better.  Burger was dry and overcooked on a burned bun and the tortilla soup was only good after adding plenty of tobasco for flavor.  \n\nAmbiance?  There was live music... it wasn't awful, but definitely not something I would seek out.  And they do have a lot of TVs, but most of them are fairly small, and since the space is pretty big, you can't really see them.\n\nSo that's that... and I'm pretty easy to please.  Maybe if we stuck to straght bar food during happy hour or for Sunday football, we would have done better.. but honestly?  I would only return if it was going to be free."
"2","absoultey love. everything is amazzzzzballs!"
"2","We wanted to dine here several times before reviewing. In short, we really like this place. Freshly prepared rolls, nice selection, reasonable prices and outstanding service. Each meal ends with a complimentary \""dessert\"" - just sliced oranges with whipped creme and sweet topping - but a really nice touch!"
"2","I'm docking Holsteins are star because the service has gotten to be somewhat hit or miss.  Sometimes on point, sometimes not so much.  Others have made similar observations, so I know it's not just me.  Let's put it this way, I skipped Holsteins on my most recent trip because I was uncertain about how the service was going to be.  And  based the service that caused me to skip Holsteins on my most recent trip, the four-star rating is itself a bit of a legacy rating."
"1","Like David who was here about two weeks ago, this is a place I would not return to.  This was our second experience here and like David said the chips are ok, but that is about it.  The cheese they use is not good, the salsa you can make at home and make it taste better and the food was average.\n\nWhat seems to attract people to this place is the happy hour times which offers 2 for 1 drinks.  It seems like they are surviving off the bar and NOT the food.  \n\nOn the bottom of the receipt is CLEARLY states GREAT MEXICAN FOOD NOTHING OVER 10.$.  This is exactly how it is written..WRONG...They should change this before someone decides to take the time to sue them for false advertising and shuts them down.  \n\nTwo people in our party ordered Fajitas and we were charged $11.00 for each.  Now I am not a math wizard, but I do believe that contradicts what they advertise on their receipt.  Also, if you order Enchilada or a burrito, most Mexican Restaurants give you that with rice and beans...NOT THIS PLACE, they charge you $2.00 extra if you want sides with your food bring the total cost of your dish, YOU GUEST IT, to OVER $10.00.  You end up paying anywhere from $10.50 to $13.00 for that plate. \n\nAND DON'T\""T EVEN THINKS OF ASKING FOR MORE TORTILLA'S unless you want to pay $1.00 per request.  \n\nThe staff has been very nice on both visits which makes the place bearable...One couple in our party was NOT impressed with the alcohol the first time around and sent their drinks back.  It does look like they took those drinks off the bill even though they FAIL to inform you of this.  They don't inform you of the extra charges or if they do something to benefit you, ITS A SURPRISE AND EVERYONE LOVES SURPRISES WHEN THEY GO OUT TO EAT FROM A RESTAURANT RIGHT???\n\nSo one last example, they offer a burrito called enchilada style, which means they put sauce and cheese on the outside.  The burrito is $7.00 but for the scoop of sauce and a little cheese, you guessed it, $2.00 extra and then if you want rice, beans and chips with your burrito, another $2.00 bringing the total to $11.00.....Again $1.00 over the NOTHING OVER $10.00 quote on the receipt.  \n\nLastly about the Fajita plate, $11.00 is apparently without meat, if you want meat, anther $2.00 and the beans offered on the side, another $2.00, that is a $15.00 plate and in any other restaurant, the price would be the same but would include rice, chips and ALL THE TORTILLA's you desire at NO EXTRA CHARGE.\n\nThis is Vegas folks, there are a LOT better Mexican Restaurants in town for the same price of a $13.00 to $15.00 plate with NO HIDDEN CHARGES, better drinks, and just as good Happy Hour Specials.\n\nThe ONLY SAVING grace this place has and this is why they will survive in this town David, is that they are close to UNLV so people who don't have cars can indulge, they are not far from the strip and they do have a LOT OF TVs for watching sports and most people don't need more then a few drinks and some chips to munch on while watching a game.  Just make sure you enjoy the chips dry as the VERY SMALL dish of salsa is NOWHERE NEAR enough for the amount of chips you get and YOU WILL GET CHARGED if you ask for MORE....\n\nThere are better places to watch sports in this town as well.   Read through the reviews, the 4 stars are from people who enjoy cheap, low alcohol drinks who think they are getting a deal.  Read Ms Fabulous W from 5/15/2011, you will really see what your Happy Hour Drink are getting you....LOL\n\nMaybe Glen Learner the Heavy Hitter would like to get his hands on this receipt."
"2","This is my neighborhood Fry's. I have been going to this location since I bought my house two years ago. They are always friendly and things are well stocked. Sometimes they items that are on clearance surprise me as it is an extra bonus, especially if you have a coupon for it. All in all, I have no complaints. Friendly, affordable, what more can you ask for?"
"1","This place has the highest prices and the worst customer service of any store I've ever been to. \n\nThe staff is snotty undertrained and doesn't care if you spend money there or not. \n\nThe corporate policy is screw the customer."
"2","When I come to Vegas I always come here its so good... I love the look of the place its very trendy and sexy and has a good vibe.. The wait staff knows what they are doing and can always recommend things..  The food is very good and fresh and they have a huge Saki Menu...  I recommend ordering a  bunch of little things and sharing that's what we usually do.."
"1","I never write bad reviews, but I was so upset after leaving this place.\n\nI called in before I came in to check on pricing on alterations and the girl told me $6-7 over the phone and so I was reluctant to bring my pants in right away.\n\n When I came to pick them up, they told me it was double that for each pair. It would have been one thing to understand that the customer was obviously misinformed bc I was surprised on the price and even explained to them what I was told by the other employee, but they had poor customer service by automatically telling me the manager would still make me pay before even trying anything. And that I wouldn't be able to find alterations for $6-7 anywhere, but it's not like I arbitrary picked $6-7 out of no where to get a cheap hem; this is what I was informed. \n\nThen they call the employee who misinformed me to make sure, even though I already got the impression they weren't gonna do anything about it. And the employee says she doesn't remember, so of course it's her word against mine, therefore they told me they can \""take the hem out\"" or \""give me a 10% discount\"". How generous of them...."
"2","I have never sat and eaten here, so I cannot comment on their meals. However, I do come here to buy a cheesecake for my friend's birthday. Cheesecakes here are fantastic. You have a variety of flavours to choose from (from fruity to chocolate, from crunchy or filled with jam). It is on the pricey side, but it makes for an awesome birthday gift. We all enjoyed it, and I cannot wait until the next birthday."
"2","Had a few amazing nights here with friends.\n\nThey are open late, super friendly, fantastic alcohol selection... and if you manage to find a table, you will have the best time here!\n\nThey have darts and some arcade games. Close to everything."
"1","This is honestly one of the worst hotels I've ever stayed in -- worse than that ant-infested Holiday Inn in Wyoming. Worse, even, than the dirtiest youth hostel I visited in Mexico. Why? Because it's overpriced and disgustingly pretentious.\nThe worst part about this joint was the lobby, which reminds me of what might happen if  Salvador Dali met Christina Aguilera in 'Moulin Rouge.' And then they had a love child. \n\nI get the idea of a hip boutique hotel. But this is just some crappy 1960s motel that they painted black and white and furnished with shitty IKEA-esque furniture. Really.  It reminded me of  some \""design on a dime\"" example on HGTV. \""For just $40 and a bit of black paint, we transformed this aging motel into a hip destination!!!\"" Except that they didn't.\nThe rooms are tiny, the bed was horribly uncomfortable and even the bathroom was...well...odd. They didn't even have a coffee maker! And the huge flat screen TV was too big for the room, so we couldn't even watch it properly.\n\nI'm also convinced the front desk worker was faking some vague European accent, too, but I can't prove it."
"1","As a Japanese national, I resent other Asians opening \""Japanese\"" restaurants, especially when they completely misrepresent and deface our culture.\n\nThis is one sad example of such revolting practice.  \n\nThis is not ramen, this is not even Japanese.  You are better off going to the store and buying cup ramen for 79 cents.    \n\nComparing this garbage to Monta is like comparing Prime at the Bellagio and Sizzler. \n\nIf you like real japanese food this is not the place to go.  If you are so numb that you can't tell the difference then this might float your boat.  \n\nYou should have been suspicious when there is a need to distract people with all the anime stuff.  I would have given NO stars if it was allowed, because that's what this place deserves."
"2","Brianna with Rouge is awesome. \n\nAfter several messages via Yelp, email and text, we met for a hair and make up trial. For the trial, we met in the Northwest, where she has a spot dedicated to just trials. I brought photos and ideas I was thinking of, and she also showed me some of her previous work. \nThen wala! Brianna worked her skills and many years of experience on me, and I had my wedding look down. It was maybe a couple shades of color off from the lips but just minor adjustments for the big day.  \n\nOn the big day, she arrived at my house early to set up. This time around did not take as long as the trial since Brianna knew exactly what she was going for. I looked flawless, how a bride should look, and it stayed all day. This includes the make up (airbrush) and hair (updo). \n\nIf you are looking for fantastic, professional, not overdone makeup, Brianna's your gal!"
"2","Best bagel place I have ever been to.  I wish they had a cinnamon and sugar bagel.  But their hot bagels or croissants are delicious. Can't complain,  so fresh and great service. They'll need a bigger place eventually."
"1","The food was terrible, arrived cold, and was nothing like the sister restaurant in Reno. I don't understand. Cafe Milano in Peppermill Hotel was so good. This was... well terrible!\n\nThe service was slow, out food was over salted and arrived cold, and we just hated it. Not coming back!"
"2","GREAT variety of foods and desserts. Great service! I especially loved the jonah crab legs AND the pesto pasta!!!! yummos! \n\nThey have everything here...duck, lame, oysters, crab, sausages, turkey, tri tips...everything literally...only thing i failed to try was the soups. :(\n\nThe crepes are AMAZING! we got an apple caramel crepe which pairs perfectly with warm strawberry sauce and whipped cream!!!! I am drooling just thinking about it!\n\nEspecially loved the creme brulee! I could've eaten more but we had to leave to get ready for the party. :(\n\nI love the decor. Reminds me of a village in...France? lol. I feel like I am in another time period. TIME WARP!\n\nThe costumes they wear are ridiculous and makes them look like peasants. A bit demeaning if you ask me, but whatevs. \n\nAnyhoo, I will be back! Love the variety! And i LOVE the ambiance. Very romantic and I'd suggest anyone on a date to dine here."
"2","Pittsburgh's Museum of Natural History is a world-class museum, no doubt about it!  The time and dedication that was put into creating a place to wonder and learn really shows.  This place was a centerpiece of my childhood and is a piece of history itself.  Back in the day, Andrew Carnegie put a lot of money towards acquiring fossils and dinosaur bones to present to the world.  In fact, check this out from their website: \""Carnegie's personal presentation of a Diplodocus cast to the British Museum triggered requests for replicas from European presidents, kings and emperors.\""  Pretty cool, huh?  I like Pittsburgh's dinosaur exhibit way better than the British Museum's exhibit in London, which I found to be dark and outdated.\n\nYou could spend a couple days looking around this place.  First visit the newly redesigned Dinosaurs in their Time exhibit.  Much more modern and thorough than when I was a kid.  The hall is bright and airy, and filled with greenery surrounding the fossils.  Most of the fossils are real and there are digital displays beneath each one providing more information and explaining exactly which bones are real and which pieces are casts.  At the front of the exhibit is the PaleoLab where you can watch real paleontologists at work behind the glass.\n\nOther exhibits hold a lot of wonder, charm and nostalgia, such as the display of birds that lines a hallway, and the taxidermied yet lifelike animals in the hall of mammals.  They also have an impressive insect collection.  I also love the early mammals room, which show cross section skeletons of extinct animals like the mammoth, a direwolf, and some early horses among others.\n\nThe geology exhibit in the room before the dinosaurs is fascinating too, and gives some geological history of the Western Pennsylvania region.  I remember the Eskimo/Inuit exhibit from when I was a kid but I just love how they've updated it, giving new information about language and how their people live today.  I could be wrong but I think the Native American exhibit could be fairly new too.  And don't miss the small Egyptian exhibit and the minerals exhibit.\n\nOn top of all this, the museum is gorgeous on the inside in its main halls-- lots of marble.  Just amazing architecture.\n\nI could go on, but I'd rather you go out and discover these treasures for yourself!"
"1","Nice atmosphere outside, inside was very crowded. The food was missing something and the hot drinks were served cold. Liberty Market is a much better bet for brunch."
"2","I love this place, not only do they have an amazing selection but their prices are always great, My stepfather works at a liquor store and he even comes here to buy his booze. The other day I came in here with some friends and we bought this new whip cream infused with alcohol... well all the air had been let out of the container or something because it was coming out pure liquid. We brought it back and they exchanged it for us. They didn't have to but they did, it was very delicious and got a lot of attention being the drunk messes that we are when we brought it out on the town with us."
"2","A small restaurant, but neat. And the servers are very cute. Nice Korean dishes here, with a fair price."
"1","Food was decent, service was lacking...entirely.\nWent in on a Sunday night with my family, there was already a couple groups waiting, but nobody seemed to know where the hostess was. Ten minutes later a girl comes out and seats in a not very crowded restaurant at all. With about maybe 15 empty tables. We only ordered only three things off the menu. 35 minutes later and there is still no food. I go back up to the front of the restaurant looking for the manager, still no hostess at the front. I wait about maybe 10 more minutes until this lady comes out, I didn't even know she worked there because she was wearing regular clothes. I told her my concern and she gave me an attitude about how she just dropped off the food a second ago. That's still about 40 min for three plates. She doesn't even apologize for the wait and gives me look as I walk away. Only thing that saved this dinner was the miso sea bass. Not worth it though. Will not be coming back."
"1","Waited long enough in line to write this review with 15 min extra to spare.\n\nOh, yeah. There is no line. I'm just standing here at the counter with cash in hand as every employee here wonders around aimlessly. \n\nUse the oreilly's  auto parts across the street."
"1","Sorry guys but this is NOT the best pizza in town.  I used to eat there when i needed something to eat after bars.....I have to admit that this Pizza place is not even good when you are drunk.  Couple of times i had to throw up and i wasn't sure if it was the wings, the pizza or too mach alcohol.  Good luck and hope somebody else takes over that place so they can fix their pizza.  Something good about it....its stays open 24/7 and they deliver all over the valley with a delivery charge, not sure how much thou."
"2","Came here on Sunday during some big football game going on so it was pretty busy!   Our waiter was very nice, and we didnt wait at all for a table.  I ordered the drunken chicken nachos...they were Sooooooooooo good!! Probably the best nachos Ive ever had!!  Before the nachos we had a small bowl of tortilla soup...the presentation of it was awesome!  They bring out the shredded chicken and tortilla strips on a plate, then the waiter comes over and pours the broth over it in front of you!!  Sooo cool, and it was very yummy!!  Service was a little slow at times, but uderstandable because it looked like each waiter had to cover a lot more tables than normal.  All in all I cant wait to go back and have the nachos again!!"
"2","Hands down, the best sushi in Pittsburgh, and actually the best sushi I have had period.  TJ, the chef, is amazing and super passionate about the food.  Do yourself a favor and sit at the bar and get the Omakase, where the chef just prepares for you based on whats fresh, you will leave totally stuffed and so satisfied.  Not only is the food amazing, but the people that work there are great and tons of fun. Have a sense of humor and bring yourself plenty of wine and sake to go with your meal.  Don't miss the late night service on Fridays and Saturdays.  I usually eat here at least once a week, sometimes, if Im lucky, two!  Truly a hidden gem in Pittsburgh."
"1","Service was terrible.  Our waitress barely paid any attention to us. By the time it took us to get our appetizer, there was a table that had come and gone.  My friend had to get up and talk to a manager just to get some service."
"2","We found this furniture store after moving in the area and reading some other reviews. Jeff was very friendly from the moment we walked in and gave a number of catalogs to browse through as we tried to decide on two new bedroom sets. There were many options at reasonable prices. The furniture came in earlier than expected and we got them 3 days after ordering. The furniture was beautiful and the staff that put it together did a great job going up and down the stirs without damaging the pieces. They were very patient with us as my mother and I had them move things around a couple times. Overall, great customer service and reasonable prices. We will be back for other pieces."
"1","What an insanely rude group of people.\nEven the Gold counter. I inquired about possible upgrades and waiving the 1 hour $15 charge. Totally rude rude."
"1","Will NEVER deal with Home Depot again. Got what I thought was a great deal on a dishwasher but actually GETTING it was another matter.  First scheduled delivery, did not get promised call day before with delivery window nor did I get 30 minutes before delivery call.  When I finally called, I was told they didn't have any and I would have to reschedule. SAME story for second delivery - did not get day before call, and after waiting on delivery day I finally (again) called the store - only to be told it would not be delivered that day. I finally told them to cancel my entire transaction, canceled my credit card and now have to go find a dishwasher.  Note, HD's story is always that \""it's a third party deliverer\"" - that is not my problem, they represent HD to me and this is my first and last experience with the company. GO LOCAL!"
"2","My fianc\u00e9 and I came here for dinner before a show, we shared the Caesar salad and the lasagna, both we're delicious. The service was fantastic from start to finish. If you're looking for a good Italian  meal, check this place out."
"2","Good place for true Mexican food. The location is strange far off, but don't let that stop you from trying their food. The food is excellent and the wait staff is very friendly, great customer service. The price is very fair."
"2","During our stay at Wynn last week, three of us came here for the first time for lunch.  We usually only eat at the Wynn restaurants on our annual visits but I particularly wanted to try the infamous drunken noodles and dine with the crystal dragon on my birthday.\n\nWe ordered the Drunken Noodles with chicken which was great and did not disappoint.  The noodles were fresh and the amount of chicken in the dish was generous.  However, my favourite dish was the Crispy Orange Beef...just delicious!   We also ordered Buddha's Feast which was a good vegetable medley in light garlic sauce.  The portion size was very good for all three dishes.\n\nOverall, we really enjoyed our meal in this beautiful casual restaurant.  Service was fine and I loved dining beneath the stunning crystal dragon.  We will definitely return next year to Wazuzu during our annual stay at Wynn."
"1","Im new to town and was looking for a good pizzeria. Sadly this was not the right choice. The pricing is good. And there hours are great for college students I ordered a 14\"" pizza and they said 45 mins to an hour.. thats fine but when it got here my pizza was ice cold.. if you need more drivers to get the food to places hot then do it.. this was a waste of money. Cold pizza. And barely any toppings. Needless to say I wont be giving them my business again"
"1","OK so I love a bobbie, i'll repeat I love a bobbie and I am a sucker for turkey day leftovers.  That being said I would give this place 1 star if it wasn't for that one sandwich.  Their bread is dry, the prices are kind of expensive and the service in any of the caps I have ever been to isn't anything spectacular (I have been to this one the most).  I guess the cap pastrami is OK too but their cold subs are tasteless, just horrible, and this is usually my favorite type of sandwich especially on a hot summer day. I recently got a small turkey sandwich with all the fixings and I ate half of it and I just gave up on it, it might have been the worst turkey sandwich I have ever had in my like and I am not fooling. The bread is the most important part of a sandwich and that is the number one thing caps is lacking, also their toppings on cold subs are plain so the whole thing comes over as boring filler."
"2","Seasonal fruit pastries are great! Apricot danish and blueberry almond cake are the best! Pumpkin cupcakes with coffee are a great way  to start the morning..... this is my go to place every morning and it never lets me down"
"2","Very hidden little place, I walked here from school (GCC). I was craving something healthy and delicious! I received the free sandwitch for checking in along with the chicken kabob Greek salad I ordered (way too much food) after a little confusion with the order,  the food was defenitly worth it!! Hands down the best chicken kabobs I've had! And I've had quite a few from different states and cities! Defenitly recomend it. The charbroil taste defenitly makes all the difference. Next time I'll read the menu before attempting to order, .. I recomend you grab one too before approaching the register :) overal great quality food for a great price!!"
"1","I just left this place with my friend, the only pro is that the waiters were super friendly and the service was fast, got our food pretty quick considering it was busy. We came during happy hour so our drinks were pretty cheap, my friend actually got wasted from all the discounted alcohol. I just got plain chicken tenders and fries, they were good but the honey mustard sauce was too sweet. My friend ordered a steak (medium rare) baked potatoes with a side of broccoli. He said his potato and the broccoli were delicious but his steak was far from medium rare and it had a chewy, plastic consistency. I really don't expect much from Applebee's but I don't appreciate paying 17 dollars for a small steak and having it taste like complete crap."
"1","If I could give negative stars I would.  Their pizza is not that great, go get yourself a five dollar pizza for better taste.  They mess up your order, and when you go to call to get it fixed they tell you, \""I really don't care sweetheart.\""  Don't waste your time unless you like shitty food and liked being insulted with it at the same time."
"2","I can dig this bar. It's chill, played some good music (me and the girls got hype when some SWV came on), the couches were super comfy and the services was great.\nI can't remember our waitress' name bit she was really great. She was attentive, she put up with one of my friends who kept ordering drinks then sending them back cuz she didn't like them, she knew all the drinks back and forth, and she was actually really pretty. Not your average Vegas waitress who is either 83 yrs old showing way to much cleavage or 24, a lil smoked out and trying to \""act\"" (no offense).\n\nSo yeah, I could dig this place...wish I could remember that waitress' name..."
"2","What a lovely chocolate shop. The Secret Chocolatier is always ready with beautiful, rich, tasty chocolate treats. I love going in the shop because they have such interesting truffles and chocolate bars for sale. They make a great selection of uniquely flavored truffles. My favorites are the aniseed and earl grey.\n\nI love that it is a family business, and you can tell when you walk in. The whole family is there, helping to craft what are some of the best sweets I've tasted. \n\nThe Secret Chocolatier has become my favorite place to buy Charlotte-specific goodies to give as gifts to out-of-town guests or to bring to family and friends when I travel to see them. \n\nCheck them out. Whether it is for a quick truffle snack or an indulgent gift box of gorgeous chocolates, The Secret Chocolatier will exceed your expectations!"
"1","I think in my opinion it is a bit waste of money. I ordered chicken wings, a large fries and a hotdog. when my order came out, it was not what I expected. the hotdog was so small I can consume it in 30 seconds. and the chicken wings are hard and chewy. Albertsons has way better chicken wings at a cheaper prices. not to mention the price was a bit expensive for what they offer. \n\nif i were you, ill save my money, make a drive to the grocery store and buy and cook ur own hotdogs."
"2","My children and I are huge fans of Cupcake Wars and Candace Nelson. I love watching her on the show, rating and picking apart other people's baking skills, so I couldn't wait to taste hers! I bought the cinnamon sugar and the vanilla/vanilla, and they were both excellent - I flew a box home to my kids in Florida and they were gone as soon as I walked through the door. It's worth the trip every time I am out in Phoenix. I had no problem with the customer service either - they were as delightful as the cupcakes."
"1","the food quality was good but their service was terrible. it was so slow and they wouldn't come by with the carts they were just standing around and talkin among each other (the workers) we paid out bill and was waiting for the change.. and she took so long just talking with the cashier, we were like forget it. then we said just keep the tip and when we walked to the door the cashier said, \"" see i told you, you make them wait you get more tip\"" i was so pissed never again going there"
"2","Was visiting Pitt a while back and everyone said Big Jims was the place to eat. They couldnt have been more right. Big Jims is a place you wouldnt even notice as a restaurant on the outside and I cant even recall any businesses surrounding it. The food is where this place really shines.  I settled on the Veal Parmesan and couldnt believe my eyes when it came to the table, the veal was bigger than my platter!  I couldnt even finish my meal and ended up taking half of it home, great value for the money.     They also make homemade wedding soup thats outta this world!    We woulda dined at Big Jim's our entire time in Pitt but Diners Drive Inn's and Dives happened to be filming while we were there and we couldnt get near the place again, bummer!"
"1","I'm shocked by the good reviews this place has.  Their burger has to be one of the worst ones I've ever had.  It literally had NO FLAVOR!  I had a bbq bacon burger with grilled onions, bacon, cheese, lettuce, tomato and mayo but none of the flavors stood out and all I could taste was the bun.  It was so bland.  Also, there were way too many people working.  I think I counted 6 people yet it still took a good 15 mins to prep my to-go order of 2 burgers, fries and onion rings.  I feel like it was a waste of $15.\n\nThe only reason I gave them 2 stars is because everyone working was friendly and their fries and onion rings were decent.  I don't know if I went on an off night or what but I'm seriously shocked people like this place.  Soooo many better burger joints around."
"1","Really disappointed in our experience last night. The crawfish were VERY tiny. Great flavor, but had to struggle so much to get the meat out of the tiny shell that it mashed it all up. Talked to our server and she confirmed they were smaller than in the past. This was our 3rd time at this location and unfortunately, the last."
"2","So some facts to throw at you: there are two version of the ride, the lower one (77ft high, 850ft long) that goes halfway across the canopy for $20, and the higher one (114ft high, 1700ft long) that goes all the way down to the end of the canopy for $30. The SlotZilla website said they'd have the higher one up by Spring 2014 but now, on July 6, it isn't available and the staff said it would be somewhere around the the end of July 2014, early August 2014.\n\nThe lower one is still a great time, one of the more fun things I've done recently. I went up the stairs at about 7:40, and waited a good 30-40 minutes I'd say. I was alone and it didn't go by too slowly so if you've got a friend with you, it isn't all that bad. The later into the night you get, the longer the lines will be. The staff were all friendly people and I had fun people in like next to me so I can't complain. \n\nFor $20, I'd do it again in a heartbeat."
"1","Deeply disappointed by this.\n\nThe performers were absolutely gorgeous, sure, and it's very nice to see beautiful dancers who aren't...hyper-inflated.  It's a classy show.  But the choreography is just boring and not at all sexy -- seriously, I've seen hotter moments on Dancing With The Stars.  I suppose I had thought that the play of lights on the dancers' bodies would allow for some really interesting and creative dance...but for the most part, it was just some synchronized kicks and bad lip-synching.  I'd rather see some well-choreographed erotic dance with clothes on.\n\nWorse still, we had the misfortune to be there when Carmen Electra was performing with them.  She's a pretty girl, but she's not a great dancer and with her gravity-defying boobs, she just had no business being up on stage with the showgirls.\n\nI wholeheartedly agree with Roland S. -- the Crazy Horse show was a waste of time, other than the really amusing interlude with the break dancers.\n\nGo see Zumanity instead.  I wish I'd just gone to see that again."
"1","This place get negative stars! I had to pick one star but it doesn't even earn one. Awful! We arrived on a Sunday evening, there were 2 other tables seated. There was a gentleman who worked there standing by the bar and another employee standing there and neither greeted us. We stood there for a minute before I asked if we should sear ourselves. The answer was yes. \nWe ordered a large salad for 3 to split with dressing on the side. Then we ordered 2 gluten free pizzas and asked if the 'classic lasagna' had cheese because it doesn't say on the menu. The waitress said there was. \n45 minutes later we get a small salad with dressing on. Waitress apologized and offered to bring another but it took so long we declined. \n30 minutes later our pizza came. One burnt the other was fine. A few minutes later the lasagna came without cheese. We never got refills and no one checked on us.  After awhile another waitress asked how our meal was and we spoke up and said, not great. She offered to get the owner. Well, watch out if you have a problem! We planned on just letting him know what happened and we were disappointed. He came to the table with his arms folded  (turns out he was the gentleman that was at the bar and didn't greet us either) asked what was wrong. We told him about the lasagna, the salad and before getting any farther he got defensive telling us his lasagna doesn't have cheese and if the waitress told us that, we shouldn't tip her. What kind boss tells you not to tip his employees???\nWe told him that's not what we wanted. He started getting defensive telling us it sounds like we do this all the time and HE never told us there wasn't cheese its our problem and kept telling us we don't have to tip the waitress and he's been open for 13 years of business and clearly he's been successful and it's us that was the problem.  I have never in my life experienced that treatment in a restaurant. I will never return here and I will tell people NOT to go here. I have no idea how they are business."
"2","Awesome and super friendly staff. They took the extra time to help me figure out what was best fr my needs and also helped me save a little money along the way. They squeezed me in for an appointment with very little notice which was much appreciated, but they were also conscious of my time constraints and were able to complete the job extremely quickly! :)"
"1","This place is disgusting. I've been here once before and left disappointed but I thought it was worth a second chance since so many people go here. If you're completely intoxicated and go here at three in the morning you'd give it 5 stars because everything tastes good at that time. Anyone that likes real 5 star Japanese cuisine knows better.\n\nFrom the second you walk in, you get hit with the smell of raw onions and rotten eggs. We started with the oysters on the half shell--inedible. They only carry a gigantic type of oyster that clearly isn't meant to be eaten raw. They were like 5\"" long and they didn't smell fresh. \n\nEverything after that was a blur. I barely are anything because every dish either looked or smelled unappetizing. Every plate was sitting on top of or marinating in layers of raw onions. Eww eww eww. And I like onions but they take it TOOOO far! \n\nIf you're looking for authentic Japanese food that is worth the trip , don't go there. \n\nNever again! I left hungry."
"1","ugh. \n\ni joined some friends here for a trivia contest on a saturday. it's an \""irish\"" pub. i hate \""irish\"" pubs... they always attract the worst kind of people, and they're always decorated like some sort of adult, alcoholic epcot center with bad faux painting to make everything look old. claddagh definitely fits that description.\n\nthe place was packed, but even so, the service we received was DISMAL. bad, bad, bad. it took 30 minutes for our waitress to bring my beer. when i flagged her down to ask for a menu, it then took another 30 minutes for her to take our order. and then another hour for our food to arrive. there is no excuse for this kind of sub-par service. \n\nmy clam chowder was bland. the burger i got, the jameson-something-or-other, was completely slathered in jameson sauce (whatever the hell that is) and some sort of gooey cheese that resembled the nacho cheese you get at a movie theater. too. much. sauce. the burger itself had a weird meat loaf consistency. on top of being not great food, it was pricy.\n\ni will never come back here."
"2","This place was AMAZING!!! Went with 4 friends and did the Omakase for 2 and then added some other dishes we wanted. The meat candy is a must have. We missed the happy hour which I'm sure is impressive as well. The inside is well decorated and updated. Great service and great plate presentation."
"1","I hate writing reviews like this for a place with such nice people, but I'm extremely frustrated with our experience here. \n\nWe brought our 14 year old cat in because she was showing potential signs of kidney failure (I know these symptoms now, didn't at the time I came in). They got us in right away on a Friday, which was great. I was not impressed, however, with the exam. It felt like the doctor was not thorough, more focused on keeping our cat calm and comfortable. My cat didn't like her trying to look in her mouth (surprise!), so she mentioned that it could be dental. Unsure of what the problem could be, we gave the go ahead on labs and were sent on our way with nothing more for a cat that wasn't eating much and acting lethargic. I got a call with the results and they were normal. He then hard sold me on a dental exam and possible extractions that would total over $1,000. I wasn't buying it, since she began eating again shortly after the visit (switched to wet foods), and had no other signs of major dental disease. \n\nFast forward two weeks, I have to take my cat in again because she's in extreme discomfort. I took her to Arrow Animal Hospital, where the doctor performed a thorough examination and (gasp) looked in her mouth and determined that it wasn't a dental issue (saved us $400 right there...). She did X-rays, which showed enlarged kidneys and a swelling pancreas. \n\nI can't help but doubt myself for not getting a second opinion sooner. Something no pet owner should ever have to worry about. I'm sorry, but missing enlarged kidneys and pancreas issues is pretty bad. That's life-threatening. It seemed like they were content with calling it a day and collecting a large amount on the dental exam. I'm sure that would've helped with her kidneys, right? Ugh."
"2","This bank is great. They are very friendly and I have my business accounts here. I have been working with them for over 2 years now and have had nothing but a great experience. Much better than Bank of America, my last bank."
"1","Tried to enjoy a dinner out with my kids and within ten minutes of sitting down, the dining room was turned into a football league sign up station.  Not kidding.  Totally unprofessional for this to go on when people are trying to dine."
"1","Hash House ... Oh No No...\n\nBigger isn't better.  A lot of mediocre food... packed with sugar...  in huge portions... is not my idea of a good restaurant.  In fact...  Just the opposite is true in my opinion.  The food is bland and sweet.  Nothing stands out other than portion size.  My stomach turned as soon as I sat down and saw the plates around me.  Never again.  Not my thing.  Hip servers, cool environment...  and bad food.  NO NO  Don't Go!"
"2","Last time, I gave Hula 4 stars - they charged for GF bread so that ticked me off. Didn't stop me from going though and I do visit more regularly than my check-in's suggest - namely because I head in, grab food and then have my hands too full to use the Yelp app (and iphones are fragile little darlings and don't react well to cobbles) as I'm walking up Victoria St.\n\nI love Hula. When I'm tired I head to Hula. When I have crap hair and dodgy skin, I head to Hula. When I've walked into town and need refreshments, I head to Hula. So why is this? I love their smoothies and juices. As I said in my last review - I eat my veggies, but as far as I was concerned, veggies were for eating, not drinking. Now, I drink my veggies courtesy of the Popeye - spinach, apple, lemon and nutmeg. It is divine! It is my cold curer - get in there as soon as the sniffles start and if skin and hair looks ropey then I order a large Popeye and I soon have a ready-brek glow.\n\nFood is great too :-) No charge now for GF bread - hurrah but something happened on my last visit. Something immense that only GF people can understand. Normally chicken soup is off limits. Creamy (not overly so) chicken soup, with chicken bits and is good for the soul, but usually comes packed with wheat flour so is off limits. But at Hula - I HAD CHICKEN SOUP FOR LUNCH AND IT WAS AWESOME! It was gf, had ginger in it - ha! potential cold had to go somewhere else after that - and it was so damn good and reminded me that I miss having chicken soup for my lunch if I'm out and about. I had the soup and sandwich deal (gf bread) which was tons of food with my sandwich packed full of spicy tuna and only \u00a35. Worth more for the virtuous healthy feeling I had leaving Hula.\n\nSo, yep Hula is well worth a visit. You know already that it's a great wee colourful haven on a dark, cold winters day with friendly staff, free wifi, awesome drinks and food, so if its been awhile, its time to get reacquainted."
"2","I love this place. I know I should be supporting local businesses but they do such a great job. They're located inside the Petsmart which makes it super convenient to pick up treats for the pups as well. \n\nI do the optimum wellness plan which is amazing. I pay a monthly fee and it includes all the annual vaccinations, a comprehensive exam with bloodwork, and a dental cleaning. For the amount that I pay for the optimum plan, I'd probably spend just that amount on ONE teeth cleaning for only ONE of my dogs. \n\nThey always call to remind me about scheduling appointments and they even call the next day to check in and see how the dogs are doing after they've gone under. I've never had a problem with the staff. Especially since they started to remember to put my dogs' name on the welcome list! **picture uploaded**.\n\nThe fees are relatively inexpensive and they're always answering my dumb questions."
"1","Service was good and prompt & we were seated right away. It's like a dated mom & pop restaurant,  with a bar. \n\nWe had the fried pickles to start and I must say they are the best I ever had! I gave 2 stars because the service was prompt, price is right, pickles were great but unfortunately the rest of our food was just OK (and that's generous). \n\nWe both ordered the BBQ dipped fried chicken plates with mac and cheese and collards. First off, my chicken and greens were luke warm. The greens were tasty but the chicken and mac and cheese were definitely under seasoned. I really wanted to like this place because of the reviews but this time didn't do it (2.5 stars if I had the option). There's a possibility I may give it another shot and try something else."
"2","I'm about as far from a hardbody meathead as you can get. But they know me; I'm the guy who frequently comes in to get the freshly prepared low-carb meal replacement smoothie.\n\nThe smoothies are delicious. I'm still waiting for them to post their nutritional facts online, but I'm sure they're solid.\n\nTheir inventory of all things related to protein, vitamins, protein, HGH, and protein, and things that are protein-related, as well as protein, and good supplements for weight loss and fitness, like protein, is rather impressive. They apparently sell a lot, so they are able to keep their prices low. \n\nIf I wanted to buy anything related to fitness nutrition products, my first stop would be Amazon.com, but my next option would be One Stop Nutrition. And Amazon doesn't prepare fresh smoothies like these guys do.\n\nBy the way, the staff is ridiculously friendly and kind. Fantastic model for all retail."
"2","Great place!!!  Awesome selection and the staff is very knowledgeable"
"1","Took my mother here for mothers day. It was very busy and we did not have a reservation but they did accomodate us and sat us at a table on the patio. We ordered our food and the waitress came out with cinnamon crisp chips and honey butter dip. It was amazing. I ordered the chicken fried chicken and gravy, it was supposed to come with green chili but the only green chili was in the mashed potato. The chicken was dry and there was very little gravy. My mother ordered the breakfast tacos. They had bacon egg and cheese in them. The eggs were dry and not fluffy overall very bland and they did not come with salsa, i asked the waitress to bring some and she did accomodate. My girlfriend had the juevos rancheros she indicated that they were very bland as well."
"1","I love this place for the items in it......NOT for the rude, lacking customer service employees who work there!! Rod Works is lucky in that there are many housewives who need something to buy while their kids are at school and husbands are working....this alone keeps them in business......because it sure isn't how they service their clients! Very dissappointed in you all tonight....especially the older lady who was very rude to me when I was trying to spend money in her store today. If u go.....know that YES they have super cute stuff....but....bring your armor to shield yourself from the rudeness. Get it together Rod Works.....you're in the customer service industry."
"1","Hankering for some ribs and brisket and tired of going to Lucille's so decided to try Famous Dave's. We got the feast for two in order to sample as many of the meats/sides as we could for a small party. \n\nSt. Louis Style Spareribs: Disappointing. Very tough and difficult to bite off the bone. The only thing saving them was the nice glaze of viscous basted sauce on them.\n\nBeef Brisket: Average. I've had worse (i.e. tough) and I've had better (tender and juicy). These were tender, just kind of bland. I slathered them in the Texas Pit sauce (their medium sauce with peppercorns) to get more of the smoke flavor that should already be inherent in the brisket itself, and was able to down them.\n\nChopped Pork: Best of the three meats we tried. Tender and pulled apart easily. Tried it w/ the Georgia mustard sauce. A little bit too much vinegar for my taste, but nice runny consistency. \n\nSides: Recommend the cornbread and the corn on the cob. Potato salad was a bit hard (wished they had boiled the potatoes for more than two minutes), and fries just your average steak fries."
"1","I hate this place. WORST SERVICE EVER! I'm not just talking about 1 bad experience. It's EVERYTIME I come here. These people are soooo rude. Bumpin my chair and stepping on my shoes without apologizing...snaring with a bad attitude the whole time. Ughh. Not only are they rude, but why is the tea so expensive?! This place has the most expensive boba in Las Vegas. Please buyers beware..go anywhere else in Chinatown for boba."
"1","do not go with this company. poor equipment and they do not service their own equipment in my area subcontract it out - means extra costs.\npoor equipment for hard of hearing people like me."
"2","It doesn't get any better than with Prodigy Electric.  I was selling a home and it was down to crunch time to finish requests from the FHA inspector.  Both the realtor and I got mixed messages of what was required re an exhaust fan over the stove.  It was less than a week from closing and work had to be completed.  I called Prodigy Electric and was able to get an appointment the next day. Cody met me there really early and completed the job within a few hours.  I thought the charges were more than reasonable and will definitely use this contractor again.  Very professional."
"2","Tr\u00e8s bons bagels avec un choix de tout hallucinant (le type de pain , de garniture, de cr\u00e8me, de pickles, etc).  Un peu \u00e9loign\u00e9 de tout, pas de place pour manger assis, mais pour la qualit\u00e9 et la fra\u00eecheur, c'est vraiment tr\u00e8s bien."
"2","The pho tastes pretty good and service is quick! A little far for a student but will probably come here again."
"2","This is a rare find in Las Vegas. Firstly some of the reviews on Yelp have the wrong Hilton Hotel. I would like to say a special thank-you to the Hilton Garden Inn for looking after my special quests. Group Booking Manager Katie Sommers went out of her way to take care of our group of people who have special needs due to being handicapped. This venue is quiet, accommodating and very kind. They add a lot of extra's most hotels and casinos charge for. Coffee and tea station and fridge. The rooms for the handicapped are wonderful. It's a home away from home for those who want to escape the crazy and large casinos filled with noise, smoke and chaos. They have a fantastic banquet room with a beautiful outside garden area for parties and events etc called The Hawaiian Gardens. This hotel is only five minutes on the southside of the strip; a hop skip and jump... free shuttles all day and night. This hotel is right next door to the outlet mall and restaurants. You won't get lost looking for your room, get frustrated with the typical average/poor customer service nor feel that no ones cares about your needs. They are a five star venue. Thank-you again to the management team Katie, Linda and Steven. Survivor's Pay it Forward and The Beyond Trauma Foundation appreciate your consideration and extra special care in taking care of our guests from around the nation."
"1","I love Pho and have been to many Pho places.  I grew up in Socal so i've eaten in Little Saigon, i've been invited to Vietnamese families that cook Pho.  I make my own pho at home about once a month so I know a few things about pho.  Jenni Pho I would rank as one of the worst pho i've ever eaten.  The broth is epic FAIL.  It's flavorless, it lacks the subtle charred onion and ginger flavor, the meaty and rich taste that comes from oxtail and bone marrow, and the spices of cinnamon, cloves, and star anise.  The noodle was ok but the rare sliced steak came out over cooked.  The size was decent but I didn't want to finish it.  I left disappointed but knowing that since i've had the worst, i know my next pho experience else where has to be better."
"1","Early check-in fee was 25% of the daily cost of the room. Desk staff is unfriendly and surly. Room service: The continental breakfast was terrible, the turkey and avocado sandwich was huge and quite good.  The hotel amenities are just okay, nothing special, particularly when paying a $20/day resort fee. The only good service I received over my entire trip was from the bell staff. They were friendly and helpful throughout my stay. Fast forward to check out. I was overbilled at checkout for an upgrade for which I never agreed. After 20 minutes, yes I timed it, he comes back and says that the person who checked me in isn't there and they can't find my check-in record (sorry, but isn't this the digital age) but that they go through a very detailed check in procedure and he doesn't understand what happened. I believe I was just called a liar. Then, instead of apologizing for their mistake, he says \""Sorry this is taking so long, but we're very careful when we're giving away money.\"" Wow. Giving away money? How about rectifying YOUR mistake? Fortunately, I had a good cushion before my plane left. And fortunately I was too tired to make a scene, Needless to say, Bally's is off my list of future Vegas stays. This people is what happens when you cheap out. Actually, that's not true. I've had better service from a Motel 6."
"1","I am very glad there is a sonic finally close to my home. I really just like to come here for the beverages. Why is the service so slow every single time I come?"
"1","I am usually a huge fan of Casa Don Juan.  My husband and I go there often for dinner and have always enjoyed it. It is close to my work and co-workers and I go there regularly, but yesterday my experience was disappointing.  I had a Groupon and went there with a couple co-workers. I ordered a Vegetarian Burrito.  I have ordered this burrito many times and have always enjoyed it.  To make it a little more substantial, I asked if I could add chicken to the burrito. The server said that it would be an extra charge, which I completely understood.  The burrito already has rice, beans, cheese, lettuce, guacamole, sour cream, and pico, so of course charging for chicken is understandable. When we received the bill, they had charged $7.99 for chicken! That is more than the burrito itself (Vegetarian Burrito is $5.99)!  Another co-worker of mine ordered a chicken burrito wet, and it was $7.99.  She wanted sour cream so they charged extra for it.  That is understandable, but charging $5.99 for the vegetarian burrito and then $7.99 for chicken to be added is ridiculous!  I asked the server what the $7.99 was for and she told me it was for the chicken, and \""I told you that would be an extra charge.\""  I told her I understand that, but $7.99 on top of the $5.99 for the burrito was not reasonable. I then asked to speak to a manager.  The manager came over and I explained the situation to him.  He responded, \""She told you there would be an extra charge for the chicken.\"" I told him I understood that, but $7.99 seems a little unreasonable and if you are going to charge that much you should tell your customers because I am sure no one would pay that.  You could order a whole other burrito for that price! He said that it was rude to tell people the price because it appears that you are implying that they can't afford the $7.99. I told him it was rude and dishonest to NOT tell your customers you were charging them $7.99 for a piece of chicken. He finally stated that he couldn't do anything, that they charged what the owner makes them charge, and \""it is what it is.\""  I was so appalled by their attitudes and lack of customer service. They didn't even try to fix the situation.  Like I said, I do not work far from there, and many of my co-workers go there because we enjoy the food and usually good customer service, but this was unacceptable.  I have told other co-workers and friends about our experience yesterday and they couldn't believe it.  They all thought it was unreasonable and dishonest and were very disappointed. I don't want to say that we will never go back, but it definitely left a bad taste in our mouths and we won't be back anytime soon."
"2","One of the best burgers in town!  Awesome fries that come in a tiny shopping basket with ketchup or chipotle sauce.  .  Place has a great vibe.  \nBurger by itself is about 9.50, a bit pricey but very good.\n\nIt's gets packed at lunch time,  so be ready to sit very close to other people as the seating isn't so great."
"1","If you want bad chinese food and bad customer service, this would be the place. I've been here a couple times just because I wanted to make sure that they didn't just have a bad day, but I was wrong. I've never back since and will never plan to go there. \nLet start my review of their BBQ side of the restaurant. I used to go here to buy BBQ duck or roast pork because they were the only one selling it. Their BBQ duck wasn't that good, but either that or driving to CA to get some. When you're threre, they treated you like #$%@ b/c it was crowded they didn't need you. Anyway, when King BBQ opened up a few block down the road, I didn't need SWBBQ either. KBBQ has much better roast duck and pork, definitely recommend it there. Now there are other places starting selling BBQ duck too, example would be the 168 market.\nNow let look at their restaurant side. We ordered a varieties of items on different trips there and all of them ranged from eehhh to mediocre. Most of the food were too oily.The floor and tables were dirty and the service was kinda suck.\nSummary, if you want Chinese BBQ, go to King BBQ down the road on Spring Mountain (and Lindell???)"
"1","I have called Cottage Chic twice within the last month inquiring about the Louis small 6L/Iron wood chandelier. I called number 910- 944-0501. Both times with the same question. What is the height of the chandelier including the chain? The sales woman said the dimensions online did not include the chain.. I wanted to make sure the chandelier would not hang too low before I purchased it.  She said she would find out and call me ASAP.. Two weeks passed and no phone call. So I decided to call again. Over two weeks later and no phone call again!! Due to such  poor customer service I will not be purchasing the chandelier from Cottage Chic.. Im shocked a store of this caliber would hire such incompetent workers.."
"2","It's good to catch this place at 12:00pm because all the early birds got the left over broth from yesterday and by noon the new batch gets cooked. OMG I am just kidding!!!! \n\nI like the Pho here a lot. The broth is clear, flavorful, and oh so yummy after a long night of ??. \n\nI was so hungry, I ordered spring rolls, egg rolls --these two are not that great. I had Pho in a small bowl with meatball was about $7. I love it. \n\nThis place is very busy for locals and out of towners. It just feels like home."
"1","Nothing special. I waited in a line for 30 mins for the much appraised crepes line. I got two different kinds the berry one and the banana nutella one. I enjoyed the nutella one more than the berry only because the berry one was way too sweet. \n\nWe made it in at the end of breakfast going into lunch so we got to eat both! eggs were bad............bacon was ok........i liked some of the pastas they had for lunch...the scallopped potatoes were ok...the desserts were not too shabby, some chic was trying to call this cheesecake square...\""flan\""...i wanted to say something but i held my breath and walked away shaking my head.\n\nthis buffet was ok. the line was long too. if youre in vegas there are always lines at every buffet...\n\nMy husband and I were not impressed with any of the buffets, reading reviews online and recommendations....did not help. maybe we have high expectations? Don't know, if we knew we would of just spent all that money on a high end place and gotten one meal...at least we would of known it was ONE excellent one."
"2","Just had another great burger but the most excellent fries were, once again, way over-salted.  Plug up some of those holes in the seasoning shaker, review the process, etc. but please look for a way to keep this from happening on a regular basis.  I'll definitely be back to check......"
"2","Menu modeste mais efficace, on comprend vite que la sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9 ici ce sont les oeufs b\u00e9n\u00e9dictines.

"1","Over priced and over hyped...  Sliders were dry. Frozen hot chocolate could be had somewhere else for half the price with better quality.  For the prices they are charging, you figure they would at least try to serve you quality goods."
"1","I have visited both locations of this store in Madison and both times I have had bad experiences. The last time I went to the store on Midvale, there were boxes of merchandise everywhere like they were restocking, but the girl working was sitting behind the counter, talking to her friend. The store is fairly small, so it felt cramped and hard to get around just because there was so much clutter everywhere. I couldn't find the price a can of food and was aggravated that I had to interrupt their conversation to ask. I have also been to the Lakeside location. After I was done shopping, I stood at the counter for a few minutes, waiting to be helped. The salesgirl was helping a woman find a retractable leash, but then when the woman was set to go, the salesgirl asked if the woman could check out first - in front of me - even though I had been waiting there for a couple minutes! How rude. Their selection of stuff is okay, I like all the different cat food that they have and the prices are decent. But I will not be shopping at either location again because the customer service really leaves something to be desired."
"2","I've been here twice, had the crepes thrice, all times the food and service were excellent! \n\nThey've only been open a couple weeks, but my boss talks about it all the time...so I had to see for myself. The first time I went in, the owners were the ones that greeted me. Friendly, smiling, and welcoming. That's definitely a plus with me. :) \n\nI told them it was my first time, and they asked me a few questions before offering suggestions on what to try. I was super hungry so I wanted a filling-dinner type of crepe. He suggested The Bomber, w/ pepperoni added. He said you can add whatever you want to the crepe. Awesome. The Bomber has meatball, mozzarella, tomato sauce...and I added pepperoni to it. \n\nThe Bomber was definitely.... da bomb! (haha lame joke. ;) ) \n\nThe crepe is a good size and it comes with a side of fruit. \n\nMy first time there I chatted with the owners and (I didn't ask for it, but they did it anyways) --- they gave me a sit down type of service. Which I appreciated a lot! Maybe I seemed confused my first time there. But the way it's set up, you order at the counter, they give you a number and they bring your food to you. Even with that type of service, the owners check up on you to see if you need anything and if your enjoying your meal. I love that! That's what top notch customer service is about! :) \n\nMy 2nd crepe, my awesome bosses ordered us some from here. I had the Sonora. It includes: carne asada steak, roasted tomato salsa, guacamole, jack cheese. It also came with a side of fruit, pineapple. The fruit is different each time. :) Which I enjoy. That was delish as well. \n\nMy 3rd crepe, 2nd time here: I brought my friends along with me. It was nice too see the owners remembered me. :) I ordered the Caprese crepe and Mimosa trio sampler. You can choose 3 out of the 5 flavors available. I chose the lychee, passion fruit, and pomegranate. My FAVE was the lychee mimosa!!! I love lychee.... and I was excited to try that one. It was delicious! I wasn't a fan of the other flavored mimosa, but the lychee was my fave. \n\nThe Caprese was good. Melted mozzarella, tomato and basil. I loved the drizzle of pesto sauce over the crepe. \n\nI forgot what my friends ordered, but they enjoyed theirs as well. \n\nBy the time we scraped our plates clean, we were soooo full but still managed to order a dessert crepe or rather a \""Sweet Yum.\"" We couldn't leave here without having one of those. So the three of us shared one. Got the Nutty Classic and added banana and strawberries! It was huge, and delicious! Nutty Classic includes nutella, fresh chopped hazelnuts, whipped cream, powdered sugar...and along with that we added the banana and strawberries! It was heaven! \n\nI'll have to try their other dessert crepes the next time I come in. \n\nWe all couldn't stop talking about the decor of the place. It's not what you would expect from the outside. Lots of purple, it's hip yet elegant. If you go, you have to check out the bathroom! the decor in there is beautiful as well! \n\nThe prices are not bad, and they have a selection of beer, wine, coffee, waters, juice, etc. Oh they also have two tvs one with the making of your crepe, and one for entertainment. \n\nIf your looking for delicious crepes, excellent customer service, beautiful decor, this is the spot!"
"1","Oh... Taco Guild.  \n\nI bitterly resent having to give you a single star.  Pretty much everything is a disaster... from high-top stools designed by Torquemada, to the brazenly over priced drinks fetched by surly independently wealthy cocktail servers.  Our server looked like a lumberjack, yet acted like Serge from Beverly Hills Cop.  \n\nI had two tacos, \""torn lettuce cups.\""  What I got was half a head of wet butter lettuce with a neat tablespoon of sodium soaked protein in the middle.  The pork adobo was indistinguishable from the coffee braised brisket.  Truly stunning for $3.95 EACH.  I have eaten more satisfying fare out of an MRE packet.  \n\nIt is loud inside, which amplifies the horrific choice to put a jukebox in a restaurant.  There is a ton of service staff, none of which will make eye contact with a patron begging for a drink.  \n\nThe chips were fresh and crunchy, and the salsas offered were not bad.  Perhaps that merits the single star I was forced to give."
"1","I decided to give it one more try to see if Modern Grove could redeem themselves.  Unfortunately, they did not.  My wife and I waited, and waited, and waited for about 15 minutes.  We thought they should come to our table very soon.  Another group came in, was seated, had their drinks and we were still waiting.  We finally got up to leave and the waiter came over and said hi.  I told him we were leaving as we had been here too long.  He could care less as he just walked off without any apology or explanation.  I would give this place a minus 5 if I could.  I will not waste my money at this place as this time was worst than the last.  I do not remember ever going somewhere to eat and not being served at all.  Worst service of all time."
"1","This review is not about the baked goods. I am reviewing the \""bistro\"" here. The \""bakery\"" is fine.\n\nThe sandwiches here are so obscenely over-priced. I don't understand how they manage to make everything so plain and unappetizing. I ordered a \""ham and cheese melt\"" that had ham and melted cheese on sourdough. The sourdough was vaguely stale and warm, but it was not clear that it had been toasted. The cheese had been melted on the bread, not the meat; there was a single, sad slice that didn't even cover all of the sourdough. The ham was overly salty, cut thick. Nothing else comes on the sandwich -- the bread isn't clearly buttered, pressed, or anything. No condiments. Just generally unappetizing. In retrospect I should have asked for a refund.\n\nThis is the most recent sandwich disappointment. I don't think I'll make the mistake of getting anything that isn't pure sugar again."
"2","Great new salon!  I had a Deluxe Mani/Pedi and it was amazing! \nLove the fact that they use disposable liners for the pedicures. It is a very clean.  \nThey are extremely friendly.  I will definitely be a repeat customer.  I highly recommend this nail salon!"
"2","I met up with two of my gal pals for dinner at Cowboy Ciao a few weeks ago while I was in town visiting family.  I had been eyeballing the short ribs dish ever since I checked out the menu online and hoped that the dish would live up the hype that I built up. The dish lived up to the hype.  The meat fell off of the bones and was perfectly tender. There was some type of cherry BBQ sauce that came with the dish, and it was pretty strong so I used it sparingly. Honestly, the meat was seasoned perfectly, and it didn't need the sauce. The short ribs were resting on grilled veggies and Gouda cheese grits. I thought that I didn't like grits, but apparently when they are done right and with a shit load of Gouda, I love them! :) I knew I would be pushing my stomach limits this night, so I only had a couple of veggies. I needed the room for the short ribs and the grits.  \n\nOur waitress was attentive without being over bearing and helped us pick out a wine and beer for the group.    Good times were had at Cowboy Ciao!"
"2","I had a great experience at this TSA check point. There were plenty of metal detectors and agents on staff to make the screenings move quickly. The agents were relaxed, personable, and speedy. In fact, my screener told my to keep my shoes on. I was in and out in a split second. This was the greatest security screening I've ever been through; invasive body and luggage scans have never been so easy."
"2","Went with a big group. Our service was very good. I had the vegetable pot stickers and veggie lettuce wraps. Both were better than I expected. The lettuce wraps came with this fantastic fried tofu with so much flavor I thought I was eating teriyaki chicken. Overall this place is pretty casual, a combination of all types of \""american\"" asian food from Chinese to sushi. Overall, the food was not very authentic but, for the price, pretty good."
"2","We purchased a half priced dinner coupon from the half price ticket booth for dinner prior to our show at the V Theater.   Service was quick.  Portions were huge, and we could not finish our meals.  We were able to get in and out quickly and were fully satisfied - nachos, wedge salad, and congee."
"2","I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed staying here. Flamingo the top choice for my parents (they get comped by Harrah's) and even though the hotel is old, it has a lot of things working in its favor.\n\nFirst, the rooms have been renovated. I'm not sure what our room was called, but judging from the pictures it wasn't a Go Room. We had a desk, king size bed, vinyl floors, and a chaise lounge that faced their flamingo habitat.\n\nLocation is the next thing in their favor. You're pretty much in the middle of strip and it's a quick walk to the other big draw casinos like Bellagio and Planet Hollywood (hey, Britney!).\n\nThe resort fee is borderline ridiculous. It basically doubled our bill and covered wifi and a daily pass to the fitness center. You could only connect one device at a time to the wifi, so it wasn't as convenient as it could have been. Plus, the TV sucks and it would have been nice to have the option to stream something."
"2","Just a small shop at the airport. They have sandwiches, salads, and a whole variety of drinks you can shop to.  Overpriced, but isn't everything at the airport?  \nI think I was flying United, so its probably close to those gates.\n\nI grabbed a salad and a bottle smoothie drink, not much to rave or complain about, food looked fresh and tasted decent."
"1","So-so. This is a Cafe Rio or Costa Vida knockoff. The food is ok but is way over priced for the portion size."
"2","I love Arby's.\n\nIt's roast beef!\n\nAnd a bun!\n\nAnd curly fries!\n\nHaters be damned."
"2","Great service, extremely friendly staff. Good food, very fresh :)"
"2","came in on a fri at about 530 and the place was pleasantly busy - good parking and seated immediately at the door.  they do happy hour 3-7p even on Friday, with a decently diverse menu.  moonshine drinks were a little fruity tooty for my taste, but my wife reminded me that not everyone wants to drink straight moonshine out of a pail.  I recommend the grilled Mac and cheese and the front porch because it is whiskey mixed with moonshine and it's the only drink that tastes like alcohol"
"2","So Im pretty convinced that our waitress at the Peppermill was the stripper from the night before who put lit matches in her nipple ring holes for my friends birthday \""cake\"".  \n\nThe Peppermill is where everyone goes for bloody mary's in the \""morning\"" (after check out) on the way home from Vegas. We had a big group of people and they were able to seat us together without much of a long wait. This place was packed, but not ridiculous so it was humming. There is a seperate wait person for every thing: coffee guy, booze lady,  food lady and so on which can make for a confusing time since its no ones job to get the coffee, except that one guy but he's in the back making crack for the rest of the wait staff (they are ALL so hyper). \n\nAny who- the decor was alright, kinda cheesy blue neon lights and stuff. The food was decent, the coffee was hot and strong and I even tried the bloody mary (i hate them normally) and it was pretty dang fabulous.\n\nAll and all I wouldn't be completely opposed to coming here again."
"2","We sit at the bar and drink coffee and eat some good homemade hash. Never had a bad meal here. It is small so if they are busy then you will wait.great weekday place to grab a meal"
"2","blanket statement- i've done a lot of things for really good food-waiting in line, traveling, bribing maitre'ds... but I'm not waiting 4 hours for just pretty good pizza. \n\nI've been watching the parlor go up for a while, intrigued by the construction, but hadn't gotten there to eat yet. SO happy we did- cancel your plans for bianco. this is better. \n\nFirst, the service was so attentive, which was wonderful. We loved the space, which was mostly reclaimed from the original building, as we were told. Its warm, and cozy, and perfect. \n\nWe did the smart thing, asking our waitress what to order, and based on her suggestions, split the beet salad and funghi pizza. \n\nBest. beet. salad. ever.  Better then even delux, which was previously my fav. Same for the pizza. You know how artisinial pizza so often falls flat on the crust? I don't want cracker like crust, and I don't want limp dough. \n\nThe parlor's pizza dough is perfect. Thin, but doughy and bubbly, baked to a golden perfection. Our pizza featured these fabulous wild mushrooms- it was covered in them, they had great bite and taste. Goat cheese and truffle oil made the flavor mellow and lovely. \n\nThe rest was such a success, we couldn't resist dessert- tiramisu. It was scrumptious. \n\nCan't recommend the place enough. I'll be back."
"1","Only place in old Vegas that looked like it had decent sushi.  We ordered 5 different rolls and all were edible but not fantastic.  However, it satisfied the sushi craving for my wife so it was a good choice - except for the prices...which are WAY out of line with the environment (Fremont St. is supposed to be the affordable and low-key Vegas!)."
"1","Atmosphere - 4 stars.  Food Quality - 3.5 stars.  Food Quantity - 3 stars.  Service - 2 stars.  Price - 2 stars.  Policy - 0 stars.\n\nWe ordered the Vitellina alla Parmigiana (27.95) and the special of the day Ciappino (35.95)  The veal portion was small and there wasn't enough spaghetti to make up the difference.  It was good.  The ciappino was not like the ciappinos that I have had before.  This was more like a linguini with mixed seafood.  It was very good.\n\nMy husband and I went there using a Groupon, and we found out that an 18% tip is added on to all groupon (and other coupons).  That made our $20 worth only $8.  I am usually a good tipper, however the service didn't warrant 18%.  When we confronted the owner, she told us her waiters do not want to work for nothing.  Maybe she should hire better waiters.  We will not return because of this - and no, it is not the money - it is a $2 difference between the tip I would have left and what I had to leave."
"1","I ate here last year and I remember the food being good, and the menu as diverse with a Southern influence. Tonight, the food sucked pretty bad. My daughter's chicken parmesan was dry and overcooked, and the pasta was dry. My food was ok. The beneighs tasted as if they hadn't changed the grease is a while. I was really disappointed. They comp'ed my daughters dinner and sent us home with a 6 pack of muffins. Would not go back. The mistakes made were too egregious."
"2","Totally love Lee! He takes care of business and doesn't rip you off. To put on tires is the same cost as Sams Club, regular Oil Changes are about $24 after tax, which is cheaper than WalMart so his pricing is competative and his staff is more than competant. We've been going to him for several years and have watched his business grow. Not only new cars but old ones as well. If you're trying to keep a beater alive or just maintain your car Lee is a great mechanic to have on your side, he does it all! I think Corinna C. must have him confused with someone else."
"2","I went to U of I and visited a few times since but hadn't stayed at this hotel until March 8, with a group of teens staying there for Mock Trial. \n\nLocation is great! Steps from the campus. Even though the Mock Trial was at the law school it was a short drive.\n\nStaff was quite friendly on Saturday for check-in, and they went out of their way to make sure all our rooms were on the same floor; mine wasn't quite ready but they sped it up for us. They were more than happy to give out extra keys for the kids.\n\nRooms were clean; what you expect at a Hampton. My son and I weren't crazy about the pillows as they were small.\n\nBreakfast the next morning was ok; I've had better at this type of hotel.\n\nLady at the front desk at check-out was not nearly as nice as the ones at check-in. Pretty surly and not willing to give us all a late checkout, even for just an hour.\n\nI'd give it 3 1/2 stars but I'll round up due to the staff at check-in."
"1","Good lord, what a joke. The first thing I see as I approach is a reserved section next to the handicapped parking labeled \""Hybrid Only\"" parking... okay, fine. They're really pushing the idea of them being \""Earth Friendly\""... pfft, don't make me laugh. We wander in and start looking at the generic looking products lining the shelves. \""Shipped in from France.\"" What? How much gas did that take? \""Shipped fresh from Costa Rica.\"" Ha! I'm sure that's cheaper and more Earth Friendly and fresher than just using local or even just closer suppliers. \n\nAnother thing we noticed as we walked through the two sets of triple sliding glass electric doors (very earth conscious and frugal) was that it was below 60 degrees inside. There are seriously big thick jackets for the employees to wear at the check stands. How much resources does it waste to keep it this cold? Especially in Arizona. I'm sure with all the CFCs being released, this place has a bigger energy footprint than a suburban block full of homes. Environmentally friendly, my dirty asshole. \n\nPerhaps the worst offense, aside from the fact that nothing is made here and instead is shipped in, is that it's all packaged in excess plastic. Everything is wrapped in plastic and in plastic trays. Even apples... I can't pick an individual apple, I have to get a little family of four and their little house too. I guess I could recycle it (if it didn't have a paper sticker on it - oops). Also, I get that part of the appeal here is the organic fad so there aren't any preservatives, but seriously - it seems like everything here expires like tomorrow. Not so Fresh, eh?\n\nLet me just hop in my Hybrid and head across town past 6 other grocery stores to the Fresh and Easy market where I can wander around in a frozen tundra environment grabbing food that's minutes away from expiring after being flown or shipped in from other countries on massive gas guzzling planes or ships then across our country in gas guzzling big rigs. Then I can check myself out and bag my own shit in plastic bags because the luxury of having someone else do it makes me feel useless after a long day at work. Then I can go home and really feel good about myself and the positive effect I'm having on the environment. \n\nIn their defense, the bags are reportedly 50% recycled material and they urge you to drive all the way back to the store so they can recycle them (they won't re-use them, but they'll send them out to be recycled - as far as I know, plastic bags aren't recyclable). \n\nWe bought fixins to make a pizza... I should've just gone to DeFalco's and bought the shit. There was a lot of stuff they just didn't have - they JUST got Pepperonis apparently (and they were just Gallo that you could get at any store). In fact, half of what they sell is their own Easy branding which is pretty generic looking (something I'm perfectly fine with). The other half is just the same shit you can get at any grocery store. \n\nTheir prices are pretty decent - I'll give them that. If they had one right down the street from me, I would probably shop at it once in awhile... and fill out comment cards frequently about their flagrant hypocrisies. Overall though - don't be fooled - this place is bullshit."
"1","I went here today. I have been going to Larrys for about 8 years. Not going back.\nI go about 4 times a year and stock up. Ran out of some items a couple months ago purchased a rack of ribs to slow cook in oven. Before they have cooked so tender no knife needed.  This past trip,  the counter person says, I have to open a new bag. Huh? Anyway, bought them,  cooked them the same as before but no joy. Too tough and fatty. I chalked it up to either a bad selection (which I didn't get to choose) or new supplier. Just told myself not get ribs there anymore.\nToday was looking at the ribeye steaks. They looked terrible. Looked like gristle running through center of the steak, and small and overly fatty - not neatly trimmed at all. Didn't get that,  got ground beef instead. When I got home, when I went to repackage for the freezer, it just didn't look right and texture seemed different. Will see when I cook it if it is different or not.\nAt register just because, I mentioned it looked different inside - did the place get new owners.  Turns out yes, new owners. I don't know that the new owners changed suppliers,  but I am guessing it is either that or buying a lower grade of meat.\nI hate to give a bad review of starting businesses,  but I go to a butchers expecting to pay higher prices for a higher quality product. I could have gotten the same or better at the regular grocery store from what I saw today.\nNever again."
"1","Went to Rudy's Saturday night and was really disappointed.  Ordered baby backs at 7:30 and they only had 4.  Said it would be 30 MINUTES before they had more.  Really, out of ribs at 7:30 on a Saturday night.  Might have been a blessing in disguise as they were TOUGH and minimal meat...did order 2 pork ribs and they were pretty good.  Otherwise, very disappointed in the food...."
"1","Really disappointed in this place after reading so many previous Yelp reviews that were so positive.  Bottom line was the pizza and cheese sticks we had were less than mediocre. I have high pizza expectations as it is my favorite food and has been for forty years and Molly's just doesn't stand up. No crispness to the crust...very floppy. Sausage is grated? No where near enough cheese especially on the cheese bread...ahem...cheese bread...hellllloooo? It should be covered in cheese.  See my pics.  One positive...inexpensive and fast...but you get what you pay for."
"2","Let's face the facts. Most movies these days suck. Hollywood is running out of ideas. Movies about comic book characters, movies about old TV shows, the same old horror film with the same creepy kid, romantic comedies that are neither romantic nor funny, and action films where explosions act as filler for a vacant plot. All of these movies are being made by business executives first and artists second. And it doesn't end there. On the off chance that Hollywood miraculously makes a great film they quickly ruin it by making a disgusting and embarrassing sequel (see Hangover Part 2). South Park had it right, George Lucas and Steven Speilberg raped Indiana Jones. Movie producers are raping all of our intellects every time they release another sloppy bucket of hamster vomit otherwise known as \""the summer blockbuster\"". And yes.. I'm talking to you Jerry Bruckheimer!..You Jacka$$!\n\nOne way to avoid being raped by another vapid, money sucking movie studio is to watch movies at the Camelview 5. You could close your eyes and throw a dart at the marquee here and end up watching an original, intelligent, and entertaining film. This is where I saw Napoleon Dynamite before everyone started buying \""Vote for Pedro\"" t-shirts. This is where I saw No Country for Old Men before it took home four Oscars. This is where I saw The Smartest Guys in the Room before it was cool to know all about financial scandals on Wall Street. I could go on and on. I have been living in the Valley for over 10 years now and almost every great movie memory I have during that time emanates from the Camelview 5."
"2","Stopped in for a birthday card and ended up getting a Mother's Day card for my mum and my mother in law and a valentines card for my husband. Great selection and nice wee shop"
"1","I was excited to try this relatively new place.  They were out of Salmon.  No excuse for that right?  The Catfish was good, but the fish tacos were cold (are they supposed to be?).  I don't send food back ( we all know why).  The fish tacos were not great anyway.  Ambiance was inviting.  The waitress was pleasant, although didn't seem to know anything about the owners, business, etc.  Unfortunately this is just another fish place that can't seem to get it right in the desert.  Food is probably overpriced.  For the price, I'll go more upscale for better fish."
"1","I came here to see Jan Rouven and that's about it. I can't say too much about the hotel other than it just reeks of smoke and I had a major coughing fit. I'm not too sure I'd stay here. Honestly, it kind of looks like a dump...not to be mean. It looks a bit old school and nothing super fancy. Staff who work here are super nice (2* for staff)."
"2","Stopped by around 1am for some Carne Asada Nachos. It was $6.50 and enough for 2 people. We killed it!!"
"2","Wub wub wuuuub AZ88 b/c:\n1.  Never been rushed, EVER in the years I've been going here.  \n2.  And we spend alot of time enjoying the Burger Au Poivre (peppery and wine-y) + Picnic Chicken + St Petersburg app\n3.  Out of towners staying in OldTown, this is walking distance for them for a meetup.\n4.  Drinks are Scottsdale prices, but the food for sure is not... a great deal for this chill atmosphere!\n\n\nIs the over diligent Give-Money-for-Pet-Charity man still lurking in the parking garage??  I've stopped parking there a few years ago for the Buckboard parking lot -- dude, I love helping out but that little old man was worse than a used car salesman..."
"1","The hide- a- bed in the coach is the most uncomfortable bed you will ever sleep in.  Bring your own air mattress if you must.  The smaller rooms will not accommodate a rollaway bed that would have  been more comfortable.  The pool and river get crowded.  We left the pool when the guards were searching for a chocolate bar.  I blame that on a guest but they should have cleared the pool and dumped chlorine into it.  The grounds are maintained reasonably well."
"2","Writing this review live. I hope the food is good because the service sucks. We tried ordering a Vegas sushi boat from two different waitresses and they both tried to push for a different boat that comes with less sushi because the 'sushi bar is busy'. We told the second waitress we would wait anyway and she said ok with an attitude. Not a good start...\n\nWell, the boat did take a while but it was worth the wait. There is enough food for half a dozen people even though it is meant for two. Tempura, sashimi, rolls, nigiri, salad...\n\nEverything was fresh and delicious!\n\nWe gave it a solid effort but still left some delicious sushi on the boat.\nAs if the sushi wasn't enough, we were also given starters as part of the meal. Miso soup, seaweed salad, and pickle cucumber salad.You also get your choice of ice cream to finish the gluttony. We picked Ginger and red been ice cream. Also props for serving x-large bottles of Japanese beer. \n\nAfter being a little turned off by the pushy nature of the service, the food redeem this very traditional sushi joint. The sushi was probably better that anything you would find on the Strip and very well priced for the quality. We will definitely come back next time we are in Vegas."
"1","I've popped in here loads of times on my way home from Princes Street, but I've never actually got round to buying anything... for me, that is so rare it's almost impossible.\n\nThe dressy things they stock have way too much glitter and sequins all over them, so much so that it always makes me think of that stall in the Eastenders market. \n\nOn top of this, I think this place is really overpriced in comparison to other high street places like H&M or Topshop, and every time you go in the staff will literally follow you around the shop telling you about all the amazing new things they have in (i.e. they pick out the most expensive things they have in stock, and come and hold it up against you). Talk about being put on the spot."
"1","Came here 2 years ago: \nThe hostess needs to be fired! First she ignored beause she was busy talking to a friend. When we finally got seated at the bar we waited 1 hr for our first food order to come! After one hour wait, each small tapas dish was still being prepared one at a time. We were starving! These are small tiny tapas dishes too! How long can it take to make a pbj sandwich. There is nothing spectacular about this pbj sandwich. It is a plain sandwich cut into a circle. The jack Daniel skewers were chewy. Food was lackluster! I think the alcohol has skewed everyone's reviews. The only saving grace was the bartender who at least felt bad that we waited so long and gave us a free drink. Never again!"
"2","Bacchanal has an FQ (fun quotient) that just can't be beat.   My journey to Bacchanal was just a hoot.  We held an office related function at this hidden treasure and simply had a blast.  The food was good, or at least that that I took the time to eat.   I was so enthralled in our belly dancer, plate throwing and eventual group dancing that I failed to really enjoy the food, but from what I recall it was all good.   The owner treated us all like family and made us all very welcome.   They also worked exceptionally well with our company in advance of the event and customize the evening to our group.  If you go, go with at least a small group and make a night of it!  Opa!"
"2","Susan in special orders.....amazing customer service!  I had a question,  she had to call manufacturer and promised to get back to me. Within 10 minutes I had a call back, a complete answer and a I feel like the issue is resolved with a fantastic out come. Kudos to Susan!"
"2","I love these guys!!  By far the best in the valley.   A family run business that makes you feel like family.  Have been using them for 2 years now and have not found ANY spiders, roaches, etc. in my house since."
"1","Since the hotel looks like a castle and my boys loved that part of it and my oldest really enjoyed the Tournament of Kings show and the Fun Dungeon, I will give the hotel one star. The beds were also super comfortable!\n\nNow the reasons for the lack of stars.....\nAfter arriving in Las Vegas for our first time, the airport shuttle dropped us off at the hotel with a 9 year old, a 2 year old, and 8 bags, we walked into the hotel only to find that we were dropped off in the rear of the hotel and was very rudely informed by a security guard that there was a phone to call a bell hop. After 3 attempts to call the bell hop and being put on hold for extended periods of time, we gave up and walked to the complete opposite end of the hotel to check in. Once arriving at the opposite end of the hotel there was a line to wait in (which took an hour) to check in. \nWe finally get to our room and request more towels and such since there are 4 of us and only 3 sets of towels. We go to eat and when we come back, the towels are on the counter in the bathroom. I lift up one of the towels to move it and there is a large clump of dark hair on the towels which I can understand being missed in the probably massive amounts of laundry that the hotel has to do it the day, but similar instances happened on 3 occassions. One time clumps of hair, second time brown stains on the mats, and the third time brown stains on a towel. All of these on 3 different days and 3 different occassions. That is not forgiveable. \nThe first impression is everything!\nOn day 3 of being at the hotel and out walking around for 6-7 hours we were sore and wore out when we got back to the hotel and we decided to take turns going to get massages at the spa. I went first. When I got down to the spa I wanted to add on a foot rub to my 25 minute massage but apparently it takes 2 different people to make a back massage and foot massage happen and even though it is a total of 50 minutes of massages between the 2, I was told it would take an hour and a half. So I cancel the foot massage because my boyfriend's massage we only an hour after mine. I go back to the women's locker room and the girl sitting at the desk says that I am already running on my time and I have to shower before I can get my massage. So I am thinking that she means that I am using up my 25 minutes worth of massage so I explain that my appointment isn't until 4:30 (it was currently 4:20). Her response was that my time starts 15 minutes before my appointment. I rinse off with water and proceed to wait in the sitting area for my massage. I bring it up to the girl checking people in that it should be explained to people when they set up an appointment that they need to tell people that they need to be there early. She argues back that they did. My boyfriend was literally still on the phone making the appointments when I left the room and headed to the spa. Now the hotel may be big, but it is definitely not that big. As I am struggling with the staff there are 2 other women who openly share their dissatisfaction with the spa also for different reasons. One told me that I would pay more if I went to the Luxour or the MGM but I looked up the prices for massages at them and they were very similar to the Excalibur prices. If I would have known that before my massage, I would have happily taken my business elsewhere. I was there to relax, not be rushed by someone. \nSome other things that were a problem are.......\n1. The timeshare people always bothering you.\n2. The amount of smoke was terrible. \n3. The one time we went to the Lobby Lounge for drinks the bartender was slow and the ratio on both my drink and my boyfriends was completely off. \n4. Only offered one show and that was the Tournament of Kings. (A word to the wise, you can get the souvenir cups for $8 at the 24/7 store upstairs instead of paying $14 at the show)\n\nOverall, it is waaaay better than Circus Circus to stay if you have kids but the kid amenities can be visited without being a hotel guest. We will not stay here next time."
"1","They don't even deserve a single star! 4 hours late and no return call after having first been hung up on and then two other attempts.  Home office didn't answer and couldn't leave a message because their mailbox was full. Called another mover!  If you want good prompt service call moveaholics. http://www.moveaholics.net\n480-305-3793"
"1","Went today for just a cake mix. I hate walmart as much as the next guy but crap their prices at smith are HIGH! Will definitely not be back!"
"1","Ah, Harem Hooka. How I adore your decor and general vibe. Nice lounge music, good looking people, and awesome looking hookas. \n\nBut, what the hell is up with your service? Even though there were numerous people working... the place felt like one person was tending to 50 tables... instead of 5 people tending to 15 tables.\n\nI just don't get it, especially since for the most part once people have their hookas... you don't have to tend much to them. Now, I know Harem has food and drinks and that is keeping people busy... but still!\n\nAlso, your heat lanterns kept blowing out. Brrr. That made it a little nippy outside.\n\nThe owner guy (or that is what I am assuming he was) seemed a little bit pissed about life. Maybe he was stressed or something but he just seemed to generally be grumpy. It isn't good for the *owner* to kind of be in a pissy mood... especially seemingly toward patrons. (i.e. he was a little pissy with me when our pita and hummus order was taking 15+ minutes to come out and I told him just to cancel it).\n\nI've gone to other hooka places and I think the \""hooka experience\"" is much better. Maybe this is because they concentrate more on the hooka aspect of the business versus the restaurant/bar aspect. So I will say it this way... If you are looking for a trendy place for hooka... this is an awesome place. If you are wanting more of an authentic hooka with faster service... certainly try somewhere else."
"1","Not the worst food that I've ever had, but quite far from the best. It was greasy and my broccoli was cold. Mushrooms had an odd texture. I wouldn't eat there again if I had a choice. The orange chicken and fried rice were good, but I wouldn't recommend the noodles. They offer sushi. It looked like it has been there for days. They do have food other than the Chinese food."
"2","Amazing customer service, knowledgeable of their products, and with a large inventory! They even have their own workshop station for newbs to learn how to put together mods, or how to use their vape. Best Vape shop in Vegas :)"
"1","The bartender ignored us for the most part.  But eventually we got served. The decor is very nice and there was a dj playing some hip tracks. When our group ordered, the waiter was trying to upsell us hard on dishes (to get a bigger bill because gratuity is included). Someone wanted only a salad but he keep pressuring them to get sides or a pricier entree. The blue cheese/garlic bread they give was interesting. Many diff flavors going on. Kinda weird tasting. I ordered the filet mignon. My steak came over cooked. I like mine medium. I sent it back and they brought back the SAME steak even blacker than before. I called the waiter and he said he misunderstood me. By this time I have not had a meal and my group was finished eating and the wait was on me.  Even with the inconsistencies, I was still billed full price and was never apologized to. I had to ask and point out the issues again to the waiter, and they gave me a free side. Big whoop. Still billed. I was ready to get out. I can't wait to go back to Gordon Ramsey's. Much better overall experience and food."
"1","The wait is already long. So understaff. Its so chaotic. No one is really running this place. Orders are taken after sitting for 30 mins. To the owner, please this is America. Why not come and help your business thrive. We are trying to help out Filipino businesses but too bad. We aint coming back."
"2","Nothing bad I can say about this store, except I wish it was bigger lol! The girls love coming here for their prizes for doing great in school or just cuz mama feels like spoiling them. The prices aren't bad compared to the toys r us express around the way, and my girls love how girly everything is! Sales people are great with the kids and they're ok with my girls looking and giggling with glee.\n\nLove the stamp program but not sure if they honor it here when I asked them I don't think they understood my question so I just let it go, ;)"
"2","The reigning champion of wingdom, so far.  I'm a Texan and these are, by far, the biggest wings you'll see this side of heaven.  The 'original' are phenomenal & the cheddar are a unique change of pace.  Try them grilled as well.  Haven't had a bad flavor yet.\nThe fact that they have an amazing beer selection, just adds to the euphoria."
"2","I only come here for brunch.  Been here twice over about 6 month.   It's part of the Harrah's chain (located in Caesars), so I can use my comps.  Even without the comps, the brunch prices are reasonable, especially for such a celebrity restaurant.  The seating areas are multi-leveled, with high ceiling, giving an open and relaxed feel and a good view of the rest of the restaurant.  Perfect atmosphere for brunch.\n\nAs for the food, everything was delicious.  Starting with the good variety of breads.  I ordered a tuna tartar - every thing's great here.  But the best was the beef steak burrito with eggs.  So rich, tender and flavorful.  Can't get enough of it."
"2","Likes: poutine, service\nDislikes : location\n\nFood:\nThe poutine here has great portions! I had the house special, with some braised beef on top of the original poutine, and it was amazing. I am so glad that we went to this one. The poutine was very authentic!\n\nService:\nThe server we had spoke perfect English and French, so we really appreciated his flexibility. The food came out fast, with everything we needed. \n\nLocation:\nWe were taking transit throughout our trip and found this place to be out of the way from downtown Montreal. Thus, it wasn't as accessible after hanging out at the touristy spots and took awhile to get here. Boo.\n\nVerdict:\nGreat place. I see why a lot of Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois people recommend this restaurant as the place to be for poutine. I suggest that people check this out!"
"1","I've been to XS twice now.. the first time was to see Skrillex a couple years ago which was amazing. This time (On Friday), not soo much. They changed the whole set-up of the club! The DJ was David Guetta.. we got on the guest list but come to find out it was only for the outside with no inside access. It happened to be a tad bit windy and no where to sit or even dance. There is 3 different lines outside of the club to wait in so everyone is confused. 1 is for VIP, 1 is for guest list and 1 for people who aren't on any list. So if you aren't paying big bucks for a table or outside cabana don't even bother. We stood in line for the only bar outside for 45min, got one drink and then left for Hakkasan to make up for the night."
"1","Stopped in for a few slices after not dining here for several months because the pizza was so bad, and now I remember why I stopped eating here !! The pizza was soggy soaked in grease and just not good. The Pizza is just plain bad here, and even though this place is less then a minute from my house I will not be dining here anymore ..."
"1","I was there at the Sterling's Sunday Brunch in mid August 2011.  Thought I try out the most expensive buffet in Vegas.  I was quite dissappointed.  First of all, I am a Veteran at the Vegas buffets.  I go to Vegas at least twice a year for the past 15 years and have eaten at every single buffet there is, including, but not limited to, Bellagio, Wynn, Rio, Flamingo, Paris, Planet Hollywood, Caesar's, Mandalay Bay, Mirage, Imperial Palace, Circus Circus, MGM Grand, Treasure Island, Monte Carlo, Harrah's, Stratosphere, M Hotel, Aria, Cosmopolitan, etc...  Therefore, my expectation of the Sterling's Sunday Brunch was extremely high.\n\nWhen I first walked in, I was very dissappointed with the small spread.  The decor was lacking as well.  Where is the ice sculpture as shown in their website?!?  Their website showed a large spread of food, including crab legs, bread, and an ice sculpture.  The buffet wasn't anything like in the website.\n\nThe most dissappointing part was the food.  There were no big Alaskan crab legs at the buffet.  The crab legs at the buffet table were hot, small, and rubbery.  You have to ask for the large ones.  You also have to ask for the caviar.  I found it lame that they would hide the food. \n\nAs for the sushi selection, it was lame.  Again, do I have to ask for the sashimi?  They had cheap items like California roll, etc.\n\nAs for the lobster, I had 2 and they were both overly cooked and rubbery.\n\nAs for the raw oysters, they only had about 10 at the buffet table and they were constantly running out.\n\nThe rack of lamb was tender but wasn't anything special.  The flavor was bland.\n\nThere were no giant shrimp coctails at the buffet table.  Maybe, like the crab legs, caviar, and everything else, you have to ask for them.  The service was poor as well.  When I asked for the food, the waiter kept telling me to go to the buffet table.  I had to ask the guy that cut the prime rib for the crab legs and had to ask the lady at the small sushi station for the caviar.\n\nFor the price of $85 per person, you can definitely get better food somewhere else like at the Bellagio, Wynn Buffett, Paris, and Planet Hollywood (dinner only since their lunch buffet is not as impressive).  I also liked the buffet at The Cosmopolitan.  \""M\"" Hotel has a good buffet as well for the price."
"2","The Faubourg is in a constant flux of renovation but no matter how difficult it is to find the staircase or escaltor amid the construction, Bangkok, nestled on an unassuming third floor food court, always has a crowd. Now many people love marveling that \""the best Thai food in Montreal is located in a food court.\"" They're wrong. Bangkok is not the best Thai in Montreal but it is by far the best Thai for the price in Montreal. Most dishes are between 6 and 7 dollars (compare to 15-18 at the better and fancier Thai places). So it's good food for the same prices you'd pay for a pile of greasy noodles at Thai Express (although I admit to eating there once in a while but that's just because they're practically everywhere)\n\nThe food is spicy too. Usually when I ask for spicy, it's not. I once saw a woman trying to return a green curry chicken because she said it was \""too spicy.\"" After they tried to explain to her that curry is spicy, she left her hardly touched plate on the table and walked off in a huff.  I laughed and thought to myself (although wished I had the gall to ask her to her face), \""you ordered a curry. What did you expect? If you don't like spicy food, why are you eating Thai at all?\"""
"1","Mediocre to almost not worth it sushi, service was the slowest in the world. Rolls were of same caliber I can find at qfc or central market (local grocery stores with sushi islands)...horrible service on top of that....SLOW!"
"1","It's not possible to give negative stars or I would for O'Brien's. \n\nMy sister recommended that my husband and I try buy a used car here because she purchased her Camry there. So we went and thought we were getting a good deal on a used 2004 Corolla LE Thursday, Sept. 18. We paid $3,000 down of our own money that day and filled out all of the papers--with the understanding that  we could back out of the deal at any time--because the car was in need of some paint touch ups and total detailing because the car had just been traded in. We were promised the car Monday, Sept. 22. When we called Monday morning to talk to our car salesman we were told that we'd have to wait to pick up the car until right before closing because the \""carpets were still drying.\"" Instead we offered to pick up the car Tuesday morning to give them more time. \n\nAfter getting a ride out there Tuesday morning we arrived to \""bad news\"" (according to our salesman). The car was not ready. The paint work that was supposed to have been completed was the wrong color--he even admitted it before we saw it. When we saw the car, we were not happy. Not only was the passenger side rear quarter panel painted the wrong color, but there was chipped paint around the fuel tank door that looked as if someone had touched it up with nail polish instead of being fixed as promised. Paint chips on the bumper were untouched. Our salesman told us that we would have the car Thursday morning and that we would love the car and it would be perfect. He was very apologetic and we understood that he was not at fault for the bad workmanship. Upset, we left hoping that we would be satisfied one week after purchasing the car. After some thought we decided to look around at a few other dealers, including Worden Martin because we realized it was uncalled for to wait one week for a car. At Worden Martin we found a 2007 Corolla LE and negotiated a price that was only $1300 more than the price we negotiated at O'Brien for the 2004 Corolla LE! We explained our situation to the salesman at Worden Martin and said that we'd return to buy the car that evening.\n\nWe returned to O'Brien's where naturally our salesman tried to talk us out of canceling the deal. He couldn't understand why we didn't want to wait a week to pick up a car we had already made a deposit on after it being unacceptable. Finally, he agreed to give us the paperwork and our check back and cancel the transaction. However, it turns out that O'Brien's DEPOSITED OUR CHECK FOR $3,000!!! I see that one reviewer didn't put any money down and bought a car. I guess that's how they can afford to do it! They refunded the money for the stop payment we had to issue through our bank and we were all set. Or so we thought.\n\nThe long story gets longer though. After a call today (Sept. 24) to my lender to confirm that O'Brien hadn't sent loan paperwork through they called back to inform me that O'Brien's HAD SENT LOAN PAPERWORK THROUGH FOR A CAR WE DIDN'T HAVE IN OUR POSSESSION! But they took our money and our loan anyway. I'm still trying to sort out the mess that O'Brien's created and hope that my credit score hasn't been affected.\n\nO'Brien's completely screwed us over at every opportunity. I realize they didn't mean to do this but how can you excuse taking people's money? Unfortunately they're the only Toyota dealer in town but hopefully we can find another dealer if we ever need parts or service. I certainly don't want to give them any money!\n\nGayle Chaney at Worden Martin took great care of us and we drove out with a car in an hour or less. They were priced more competitively and were decent to negotiate with."
"2","They do serve carry-outs, meaning you fill out whatever you want off the buffet - and they weight it.  Price won't break the bank - for sure! :) I really could not dine inside and stuff my mouth, for the sake of dollar's worth. Feeling so bloated afterwards. Buffet carry-outs defy IS worth every dollar AND I still can save some for later in the ref. :)"
"2","Overall I liked this place.  The food was good, the servers were attentive and the atmosphere was chill.  \n\nThe servers had a team game plan so someone was always asking if we needed anything but it wasn't over whelming.  We had the ancho chile wings and they were really good, a little heat but not too much and the wings themselves were well cooked.  We also had the crab pups which are hush puppies made out of crab cake type stuff and they were ok buT I'm not a huge fan of fried stuff.  We also got the Greek pita with chicken, Maybe the highlight of the meal.  All of the food was better than your typical bar food and very reasonably priced.\n\nThe only flaw I had was their beer selection was a little ho hum.  A few craft beers but nothing stood out.  I would had given five stars but they needed a bigger variety.  \n\nWe would go back for sure to try a burger."
"2","I absolutely love this little market. It is a year round, all weather type market. It is old, in doors, friendly service and great produce. There are also little knick knacks and home made treats. I especially like the tomato pie and veggie lasagna in the freezer section. The produce is fantastic- you can still find a fresh heirloom tomato in the fall (he has a green house). You feel like you are stepping back in time (except that they do accept debit cards- unlike most markets!)"
"1","Similar to other reviews, I came for cheap and fast Chinese. \nBe careful - when they say \""steamed\"" they mean \""not seasoned\"". \n\nUnfortunately the food is flat and rather boring.  There is an insane amount of variety on the menu to be overwhelming - this is typical of smaller Chinese places in my experience, but still disappointing.  Why not feature several things you do well, instead of an innumerable amount of things you do dreadfully?\n\nHad mixed steamed vegetables with a brown sauce over white rice.  Everything was absolutely scary - I had chicken, but it was absolutely unidentifiable as chicken.  Scary."
"2","If you are looking for fresh salad,soups,deserts and great quality and friendly service Sweet Tomatoes is a great place.\nAlways consistent with fresh food and relaxing place to bring yourself,family and friends. Shopping Galleria Mall Is Rocking With Christmas Sales As Well Jojn \""Wurkin\"" Burkin"
"2","First time here. Absolutely impressed! The ambience is nice, the food is delicious, the service is quick and friendly, and the presentation is spot on! \nWe ordered the crispy rolls, tom ka gai (this will be my go to cold weather soup from here on out), drunken noodles with chicken, chili basil, and mango sticky rice. It was all delicious! \nWe will be returning!"
"2","Go for their half-off lunch sushi menu - you will NOT be disappointed.  Only complaint is that out of a group of three, one person had their rolls come out about 5 minutes before the rest of ours and the service left a little to be desired - but definitely worth the wait for half off.  Great selection of rolls and some delicious sounding house rolls!"
"1","Hhhhmp.  I had a big fat gift certificate to use here and so I made an appointment for a salon cut and style and a pedicure.  What a let down.  \n\nFirstly let me say that the lady that cut my hair spent a few minutes examining my hair and asking me how I care for it and wear it, which was a good sign that she was gonna really listen to me and what kind of cut I needed and wanted.  Sadly it ended there.  \n\nWe went from the hair wash station to the cutting chair where she asked me if she could take 2 to 3 inches off, and I said okay.  So she started cutting, and cutting and cutting and then she asked me to stand up because my hair is so long she needed to cut even more of it so it would clear the back of the hair.  Folks, believe me, she cut off far more than 2 to 3 inches.  \n\nNext thing I know the receptionist brings over a woman and introduces her as the technician's next appointment and then seats her about 5 feet away from us.  This must've put the stylist into a tizzy time wise because now she subtly complaining about how thick my hair is and how she's struggling to blow dry it all out and straighten it.  Ironically my hair is 90% already, except for a small wavy part in the very back. Then I heard her quickly say something about thinning it out in the back and the next thing I know she's thinning out huge sections of my hair in the back without even confirming that this is what I wanted!!  I didn't know what to think.  I asked her what was gonna happen when I tried to put my hair in a ponytail now and she assured me that I won't be able to tell, because she cut it all out of the center of my hair (?) but still, shouldn't she have asked me if it was okay first?  I assume she did it because my thick hair was taking too long to blow dry and she was pressed for time.   \n\nAnyway, she finished off the styling that she decided I wanted on my hair and turned me out if the chain and pointed me in the direction to go pay.  Never once did she ask me what style I wanted that day, she just basically cut my hair and blow dried it straight.  I had to go home and curl my hair the way I'd hope was included in my visit that day when I asked for a cut and style.  What a disappointment.\n\nThen I went to get my pedicure.  The place was jam packed with ladies trying to get their nails done before Easter so I knew I was gonna be rushed in and out of there, whatever.  \n\nWell my pedicure went fine and dandy all the way up to the point that I pulled my feet out from under the UV drying light and looked down at them only to see that they were dull and flat with no shiny top coat at all.  I showed them to the guy that directs the customers to the different nail techs and he went and got the lady that did my toes (she was already working on someone else) and she said I probably just chose a flat color.  \n\nHuh?  What??  A flat color?  First off I only had the vaguest recollection of ever knowing that such a thing even exists, but secondly, shouldn't flat nail polish colors be in a different section, or clearly marked or something so this doesn't happens??  So she gave me a second coat of clear polish over the top really quick (which promptly wrinkled my flat nail polish and make it look worse) and I left out of there extremely disappointed in the whole experience.  I still have a huge balance on my gift certificate and I'm not sure what spa experience I want to try next.  I'm almost afraid of more disappointment.  :("
"2","Came by here on the way to Lake Mead for some snacks. Some of the snacks were on sale so I was happy that we stopped here. I got great deals on candy and I refilled on aspirin just in case anyone got hurt at the lake. \n\nThe service was good and the deals were even better!"
"2","I have eaten here 3 times and the food is excellent. I had a pad thai salad, guacamole salad, and vegetarian lasagna. The combination of ingredients and the flavors were wonderful. The food was very satisfying and I felt good after eating it. I recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants a healthy and tasty meal. I will definitely be going back!"
"1","Horrible! I purchased a Living Social offer and scheduled an appointment. They outsourced my cleaning and the guy that came in was a complete scam artist.  Upon arrival the tech proceeded to tell me that I had a special colored tile and it would require a \""deep clean\"". He offered me a great \""deal\"", throwing out numbers and then landing on $190, since he was generously applying my $50 voucher from Living Social against the total cost. He never asked me if I agreed to the additional charge, just began the job. The charge appeared on my credit card for $199.99. I called to complain about the entire experience and ask for a refund and the company told me I should have told him no and sent him away, or if I was uncomfortable I should have called the company and told them at the time. I will be disputing the charge with my credit card company."
"1","TERRIBLE!  TERRIBLE!  TERRIBLE!\nI am requesting State authorities to investigate this office.  They provide no relief, they do not follow simple insurance protocols, their office staff is greatly misinformed, and they charge exorbitant fees.  They recently sent me a bill for almost 2 thousand dollars for service they say they performed one year ago.  I am beginning to believe they are running some sort of SCAM.  For some reason, they failed to bill my insurance, probably because they would not pay their ridiculous cost, even though I am covered by two insurance companies.  You would think their mission is to inflict pain rather than resolve it."
"2","When the moon hits your eye like a big American french fry, that's amoorreeeeee....\n\nEh, what? A little confusing that the Italian branch of The Dogs restaurant chain has gone all American on us, but trust me, it is a good thing. \n\nAfter I saw Jurgen D's review proclaiming that it had gone \""all yanky\"" I was curious! Then seeing their tweets about a PB&J Cheesecake (peanut butter and jelly cheesecake) even more so. So one Sunday I stopped by here for a lazy long Sunday linner (lunch and dinner, do you think it'll catch on?) at 5pm.\n\nIronically I went for one of the less-American themed things on the menu but my partner had the burger. The new menu still has the old Italian favourites of pizza and pasta, but there's now burgers, a larger grill menu with steaks and the desserts are American-tastic. The aforementioned cheesecake as well as chocolate brownie.\n\nThe ambience here is nice in a relaxed way. Huge tall ceilings and mainly white, white, white walls leave it feel very airy and open although it does get warm in a comfortable way. The waiters were all really friendly and prompt, despite that at the beginning of the evening there was only one guy one and it was busy at 5pm.\n\nThe only thing that I was a little put-down by is the presentation of the meals. Now, The Dogs provide good grub with slightly 'different' dishes (the regular The Dogs offers stuffed lamb's heart for example) but at affordable prices. However, as a result the presentation is just a little...lacking.\n\nFor example, the burger. It came as a burger. On a plate. That was it. Slap bang in the middle of the plate, one burger. No wee side pot of sauce, or a little side salad. And you need to order chips seperately. So that bumps up the price. The burger was, I think, around \u00a37 and add on chips for \u00a32 and that's \u00a310 for burger and chips. The verdict? Nice. But not the best he's had.\n\nAlso, my swordfish steak from the grill menu. Again, I had to order a side of rocket and tomato salad as the steak came as was. Now, I quite liked this at the time as I usually request NO chips if it does come with, and liked that I could add whatever side I wanted on. But the portion was really, really quite small. It said 8oz on the menu, but considering that there was a large piece of spine bone going down the middle of the swordfish steak it meant I didn't get much meat out of it. I'm a wee lass, and paid \u00a38 for something that left me wanting more...\n\nBecause, to be honest, the food was good. And I think if you'd ordered something different that was more filling naturally it would be good value for money. It was just my option.\n\nThe tiramisu for dessert was scrummy too. But again, it's just a slice of tiramisu in a bowl that's slightly too small for it (much in the same way that if you ate it everyday, your jeans would start to be just that tad too tight). If you expect good food but without the fuss of nice presentation, but rather how you'd serve it yourself at home, then you'll be a happy bunny.\n\nOverall, yep, thumbs up from me. It hit the spot. And we got to take our wine downstairs to Underdogs after to mull a bit longer. It's probably a good thing I didn't leave stuffed, the new menu is fun. The pizzas are also on the average-portion size (again a good thing) which I noticed from other diners. But if you're looking for an all-out epic feast, you might be left a little hungry..."
"2","Typical Red Robin."
"1","Service was great. Food was below par and not worth the price at all. Really there was a major lack of flavor and originality."
"2","Mmmm! A friend and I decided to try this place during AZ Restaurant Week, because we could never afford the menu otherwise.\n\nThe atmosphere and modern yet, dark and cozy. The shiny blue tiles on the walls gave it a shimmering \""sea\"" affect and the tables were an elegant dark wood. I've never seen an oyster bar quite like the one that greets you when you walk in the front door. It's a half circle and the seats are Vespa type scooters, with the brake lights on.\n \nThe oysters were awesome, and I loved the atomic horseradish and blood orange mignonette that came with them. It was fun to create each oyster bite a different way! We also tried the seared pork belly with figs appetizer - so sweet! These were four small pork belly \""bites\"" with intense fig flavor. \n\nMy friend gobbled her Lemon Prawns and Lobster Ravioli dish and kept dreaming about it days later. I had the Braised Short Ribs with a dreamy, creamy polenta. The meat had the perfect \""melt in your mouth\"" quality it's supposed to and the Barollo Wine gave it a nice flavor. \n\nDessert was panna cotta and tiramisu, both enjoyable but I'm not much of a dessert person to comment. The waiter offered me a chocolate cake instead of the tiramisu and I said yes, but I guess he forgot and brought me the tiramisu anyhow. He was attentive, but I did sense an air of ignorance from him once he realized we weren't drinking and intended to order from the Restaurant Week prix fixe menu, but maybe that was in my head.\n\nOverall it's worth checking out for some tasty seafood. I might be back for oysters during happy hour!"
"2","I ordered the ham steak & the bf ordered the charbroiled pork chops. Both were soooo delicious!!!! Everything from the entree, to the \""batter bites\"" & toast was perfect. The atmosphere is cozy & we both liked the idea of this place being hidden & far away from chaos.\n\nWe will definitely be back!"
"2","Came her for my birthday dinner on a Sunday night.  Made a reservation for 4 people in the car on the way there via a link on their website.  When we arrived, we were seated immediately.\n\nThe cozy atmosphere was great: dim lights, warm fireplace, very romantic.\n\nI had the opportunity to try their steak, lobster tail, chicken, and salmon.  I only have one word for the quality of their food:  WOW.  Although I had asked for the steak well done, it came out medium well and was so juicy and tender.  The lobster tail was cooked and seasoned just perfectly, as were the chicken and salmon.\n\nWe tried the creme brule and chocolate cake for dessert.  They were fantastic.  The cake was more of a mousse than a cake.\n\nOverall the service was a tad slow but our waiter was super nice.  I prefer this place over the keg anytime because of the cozy atmosphere, scrumptious food, and pleasant staff.\n\nI will definitely be back!"
"1","Ok, really? Shadow Puppets on the Vegas Strip?\nReally, I'm Serious.\nA Video game - it was like watching your kids play on their playstation 3.\n\nI would not suggest any one pay their hard earned money to see KA. Two thumbs down... Go see Mystere at Treasure Island.  \n\nThe Story line was aweful... the aerial display was old and tired.  I have seen better on \""America's Got Talent.\""\n\nPlease, Please, Please don't waste your money or time.  Unless you own a time machine and can go back in time before you made the decision to buy the tickets."
"1","The place was clean.  They do encourage you to take out. Order was wrong peirogies mislabeled asked for mushroom  was labeled mushroom got meat.  The stuffed cabbage was undercooked  hopefully it was just a bad day for the kitchen."
"2","You have to understand what this place is in order to get the full enjoyment of it. Is it \n\nMy group of friends had a great time, and in the end, didn't mind coughing up the $17 just to get in the door. They dress you up in a parka and Uggs, and give you gloves for your glass. You then drop off all of your electronics and other belongings in a locker, and walk into a refrigerated room set at 50 degrees before progressing to the bar itself. \n\nEverything is truly made of ice, from the tables and benches, to the chandeliers, even the glasses themselves! I really enjoyed it for the novelty."
"2","This review is for the service center:\n\nI really actually miss going here for my regular oil changes, moved and the dealership out here. The guys were great, I'd make an appointment and they'd take care of my car. I didn't get up sold by a service manager on stuff that doesn't need to be done. They completed the work on time. My car was clean when I left and they'd scan whatever coupon special they had.  It was easy and they had friendly service. Oh I also miss having Total Wine nextdoor to go to while getting oil changes :)"
"2","Went to Bistro for NYE dinner. It was AMAZING!!!! I had the steak which was perfectly cooked and delicious, and my fianc\u00e9 had the lamb which he really enjoyed. I would definitely eat here for dinner again and am glad we gave it another shot after the brunch left a lot to be desired."
"2","Yelp just never steers ya wrong.  Ever.  Case in point, Fiamma last night.  It is, as reported, in a strip mall, and we would have driven right by not giving it another thought, except that there are a number of Yeeps out there that called this place out as surprisingly delicious.\n\nFIamma does its best to transform your experience from strip mall to elegant once you walk in.  My eye, for example, was immediately drawn to the wood beams installed across the, well, strip mall drop ceiling tiles.  The beams are beautiful and substantial, and the ceiling tiles made me smile.  Work with what you've got!\n\nOur waiter was perfectly attentive, knew the specials menu by heart, and was able to answer all of our questions.  He brought a lovely bread basket served with fresh homemade pesto.  The pesto was an easy 5 stars.\n\nI second the suggestion of other Yeeps to order the grilled shrimp with grilled zucchini.  Yummy!  I think the dish could be the tiniest bit better if they switched to a larger shrimp, but that is a suggestion I can make across the board to most restaurants.  Sometimes bigger is, in fact, better.\n\nThe best meal at the table was the oricchiette pasta with fresh seasonal vegetables.  The pasta was cooked to the perfect consistency, and the vegetables tasted garden fresh.  It was a lovely meal that could have come out of someone's home and garden.\n\nWe did order dessert and coffee.  I was not a huge fan of the coffee.  Frankly, if you are going for top notch Italian, I think it is worth the investment to serve Illy or Lavazza, and if you're a commercial operation brewing into a hot-pot glass pot, throw it out already and go thermal carafe (this is the 21st century, after all).  The dessert, however, a chocolate torte served with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream, was super creamy and decadent.  A wonderful finish to a delicious meal.\n\nIf you are in the neighborhood, do not drive by.  Give this place a try.  I think you will be very pleasantly surprised."
"1","If you're looking for a healthy meal with tons of Gluten Free or Lactose Free options - Nourish is your place. I was dining with my friend Michelle who had come off of a massive pig-out stooper and was looking for a lighter, healthier dining experience. I ordered the eggplant Parmesan and it was good although maybe because I am pregnant I couldn't really get into it as much as Michelle was. She had the protein burger and enjoyed it as well. I will say the atmosphere isn't anything special and because of it's size it can be a bit noisy inside. It is tough to access the restaurant because it is located in the Optima in Scottsdale so parking is in the underground garage. The service is great and the friendly staff help make it a pleasant experience it just wasn't a place that I was head over heals for...."
"2","After living within walking distance of this neighborhood gem for 8 years I finally tried it one night after a long day at work (and coming across great reviews).\nThe place is clean and very basic.  The real delight is the little old man who seems to be at the counter every day. He is so upbeat and friendly, and sharp as a tack. This place has a very loyal following and I'd attribute that to him as much as the well priced and yummy food!  You can't beat the price and the portions are generous. \nWith all the places that are going under these days I am confident this neighborhood staple will be going strong for a good long time!"
"1","Hey Yall....i honestly feel that these folks are going to run me out of AZ for my honesty...but oh well. I AM BEGINNING TO THINK WHEN I TAKE A PICTURE OF AN EATERY B4 I EAT I JINX MYSELF...Lets do a rating scale 1 to 5...1 = LOWEST 5 = HIGHEST CUSTOMER SERVICE 1 AMBINCE 2 FOOD 1...This was by far the worst pizza experience ever...The bartender/server was rude...He offered free samples to the couple next to me, provided plates, and condiments...for me nothing...Never asked me if I wanted a plate...I mean do I look like a savage to not need a plate...ummmm is it okay if I order a drink....finally received my ginger ale nothing special but name not good very bitter and I am quite fond of ginger root...read bottle LOW SUGAR...yucky...back to the pizza BURNT at the BOTTOM....SAUCE NO FLAVOR....OLIVES was the BEST THING olives really AP...yep olives...oh yeah by the way I ordered the sonny boy...HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT or MAYBE THEY JUST DIDN'T LIKE ME....shrugs and hands leftovers to a homeless guy...hope I didn't piss him off :-("
"1","I was excited to try this place out.   Seating is very limited and wait times are around an hour.   After waiting for an hour to be seated, We waited another 30 minutes for a server to come and get our order and drinks.  When food came out it basically In-and-Out burger.. Food was gross..   Tried to talk to the manager but could get anyone's attention because they are so understaffed..  Will not be going back."
"1","I went there on a Friday night for an 8 o'clock show, and you figure that their might be some employees to help out at the concession stand. \nBefore I go into that, I just have to add that having 3-D movies and not having 2 dimensional availability is down right crooked.\nOn with the concession stand- So during prime hours there was one guy running the whole thing. I knew what I want: nachos- that's it! I took it out the warmer and proceeded to the cash register. No one there. The guy was tinkering with some lady that was navigating all over the line: to the popcorn, to the soda machine, to the candy, and back to the popcorn. He directed her to the cash register and apologized to me and added, \""sorry, but she was here first.\"" I returned my nachos to the warmer and stormed off to the movie.\nAfter the 3D unworthy movie finished, I passed by the concession stand. It's passed 10 pm, only 4 or 5 movies left before they close down for the night, and there are 4 employees behind the concession stand and no one in line.\nI hate to add to the Vegas unemployment, but if those people aren't gonna do anything useful, I think they should be laid off. \nEven when I purchased my ticket, the ticket stub ripper was right beside the the ticket purchase area. Talk about mixed up prioritizing!"
"1","Terrible service. I had came here for dinner with family and we all placed our orders: won ton soup, kimchi fried rice, and japchae. The food that arrived: 2 orders of won ton soup and kimchi fried rice. The person who brought the food came with 2 orders of won ton soup and kimchi fried rice. There was a very clear mistake that was made but the server just looked a little confused and took the second bowl of own ton soup back. No apologies or acknowledgment of an error was made. I assumed that he went back to get my order so I waited...and waited. No one came back to check on our table, and when we tried to get the attention of our waitress, she avoided us like the plague. \n\nNeedless to say, I did not get my meal and by the time we got someone's attention, the other people in my party had finished eating. We complained to the manager and left. \n\nAs far as the food goes, the won ton soup had a measly 2 won ton in it and the kimchi fried rice (which I had tasted) was absolutely nothing to write home about. It was mediocre at best. They really should tout the head chef as a tv-competition winner with food like that, and she should be ashamed of the servers who bring down her name. \n\nBottom line, this place was very disappointing."
"1","this is one of the nastiest places to eat in PHX. the guac tastes like feet. the margaritas are terrible and they don't have frozen ones. the meat in the burrito tasted like over spiced rubber. the staff was highly lazy.\n\nrun from this place."
"2","Usual costco, but the guy in the TV department was very helpful and honest.  I just wanted to comment that he is a great guy.  They were out of stock on what I wanted but I bought at costco.com based on his helpful input. Thanks."
"2","My boyfriend and I have been here a few times now, and we always leave quite satisfied. The fish quality is great, and they have great dinner specials. I mean, 3 specialty rolls for $25.00 is a phenomenal deal! The service is always pleasant, and the restaurant ambiance is relaxing. If you are looking for good sushi at great prices, I recommend Ohjah."
"2","I had the opportunity of going on my first Gateway Clipper cruise a month or two ago. The entire boat was rented out by my workplace, so it was a lot of fun knowing everyone on board. \n\nThe weather was relatively nice, though a little chilly. My friend and I were quickly approached about beverages, though it took a long time for the waitress to return with our drinks. However, I can understand that the top deck was pretty packed, and it seemed challenging for the staff to maneuver all the people, especially while carrying beverages.\n\nMost of the team moved downstairs when our co-workers began playing Minute to Win It games. The Gateway Clipper Fleet staff did a great job with the games, and both the participants and observers really enjoyed them! However, I was frustrated that the minimal appetizers available were put away when the games started, at least an hour before we returned to our little dock. In addition to my drinks, I ended up only getting a few semi-stale pretzels and greasy potato chips sitting on the tables.\n\nOverall, I had a fantastic time! However, I would've expected better service and appetizer availability on the boat if I had paid for it myself."
"1","The family and I are in town for Spring Training and we were looking for something low key near our Hotel.  With such great reviews we pulled up at 7:30 PM on a Sunday and I expected to have to wait for a table.  There was ONE other family in there eating.  That should have been a sign.  We were sat by a really nice, young, waitress.  She took our drink order but was not very knowledge about the wines available.  We ordered a house Chianti and a house Cab Sauv.  The wine came out and smelled like stinky socks.  The \""Anti Pasta\"" was a little bit of mystery lunch meat on top of shredded iceberg.  I thought the stench I was smelling was my Wine fermenting while we were there.  The was a sewage smell in the air.  When I went to the restroom I walked into a wall of sewage smell.  It was pretty bad.  That was it for me.  The pizzas came out but at different times and it was actually decent but I couldn't get the sewage smell out of my nose hairs.  Maybe if you went in, didn't order wine, didn't order an \""anti pasta\"" didn't sit at the table closest to the bathrooms and ordered a plain cheese pizza you would like this place."
"2","Small unassuming sparsely decorated little place in a Safeway strip mall.  What it lacks in curb appeal it fully makes up for in price flavor and quantity.  I had the tofu chow fun, vegetable spring roll and my daughter had orange tofu.  All of the food was extremely fresh and beautifully prepared.  As someone who eats a lot of tofu this was very satisfying. The staff was very pleasant and service for takeout was fast without cutting corners.  So glad to find this local gem."
"1","It's been five minutes and our kids menu food is not out yet. Neither are the appetizers. We know the food will be good when we get it, but service is not on point."
"1","The place was nice and clean and the staff was friendly until I asked for a change in the order. It was changed immediately but the delivery of the replacement item was, shall I say less than friendly. I was surprised by the price of the iced tea, my bill went from 17 dollars to 25 dollars when two cups of iced tea was added. I should have complained immediately, but as it was my first time there, I was willing to blame it on  my not asking for the price prior to ordering. We ordered ribs, brisket, and an additional half pound of sausage. The meat was horrible, and I am not talking about just one item, or the item we asked to have replaced. I mean all the meat was awful. The ribs were old and had no taste other than wet pork. There was no glazing or any kind of preperation to the meat that would rate as barbecue. The brisket was completely tasteless and had the appearance of sitting on a steam tray for hours. As they do catering, perhaps it was leftover from a recent event. I won't even address the so called sausage, it was just that bad. On a brighter side the beans and coleslaw were excellent... to bad this wasn't called Dickeys beans and coleslaw house. So one star for the friendly reception and fast service and one star for the side dishes. If you are reading this prior to going, do yourself a favor and just dont go."
"2","It's kinda pricy but it's all worth it."
"1","I never realized how gross this place was, until I went sober with a group of 13 from work. Yes, it is great to be on the lake, but the place needs some major renovations. The inside smells horrible... like old and soggy and dusty. I ordered a salad with salmon which was disgusting. I think the salmon took on the flavor of the smell of the inside which was nasty. I have enjoyed the chicken quesadilla and drinks before, but that's about it. Actually, I forgot, their Sunday brunch is pretty good and they do a bloody Mary bar that is good too. Don't take a large group because they act like accommodating you is painful. They also took forever when the restaurant seemed fairly dead. They need to remodel and hire a new chef to re-write the menu because you cannot beat the location. They also need more boat slips... it always fills up fast on the weekend!"
"2","I don't really shop here regularly, mostly only during the Black Friday sales. But I do have family members who shop here on a regular basis, my sister, my brother-in-law, my mother-in-law (my husband's mom) and my mom (who bought my sister and me jewelry one year for Christmas). \n\nGood selection on active wear (Adidas and own labels like St. John's Bay) including swimwear (summer). Good selection on jewelry- tanzanite stands out (I chose a smoky topaz (brown) silver bracelet and matching necklace- one piece was for my birthday, also in the same month, I don't remember what my sister chose). The winter coats for women is particularly impressive- watch for sales, especially during Black Friday, otherwise the prices are ridiculous, $200-$300. I had a classic black wool pea coat on my wish list one Christmas- it is one of my warmest coats. Good selection on men's clothing and suits. Come to think of it, I've gotten lots of clothing from here, via Christmas or Birthday gifts. Better deals for credit card holders- mailed coupons.  \n\nThis store is pretty big. There is a hair salon, gift wrap center, and other customer center (JCP catalog) in the back. The covered parking garage connects to this side. BTW, two entrances each lead to each major wing of the mall."
"1","Went here for drinks and dinner and had a poor experience.  While the food was just all right, and the drink selection about the same, the service makes me not even consider coming back.  I sat at the bar with a friend and there were 4-5 girls working the bar, only one of which would ask how we were doing. We had to flag someone down to take our food order because nobody would acknowledge us.  Maybe it's a bad place to work because most of these girls looked miserable.  We got in around the end of happy hour and there was barely any seating.  I wouldn't recommend this place, hit up the Thirsty Lion instead."
"1","This is a fantastic location. I was scratching my head when the Food Bar closed wondering why. Now after eating at the Metro Brasserie, I'm wondering if the location is cursed. Perhaps it was built on top of an old graveyard. It would be interesting to go back in time 600 years or so to see if every trading post put up there failed as well.\n\nSo what's a failure here? Well, it's the food. The burgers were shit. Burned and dry. The bun was the same. The fries weren't so terrible, but everything else was. My friend asked for a replacement burger and I was discouraged enough to simply ask to try their mac and cheese. My friend's burger this time was burned on the outside and raw on the inside. Raw. I mean, it was still cold. The mac and cheese was bland, dry, and awful. Did not finish anything except the fries. \n\nThe service was good in the way that they were very nice and polite and they really wanted us to be happy. I can't say they got everything right, but they definitely tried. +1 for that... A for effort. \n\nI thought the whole thing was overpriced, but they could've charged 10 bucks for that food we had and it would've been too much. In fact, I don't think they did charge us for the burgers... we just overtipped. I just mean the prices on the menu are a bit high. The location is beautiful though, so hopefully they'll get their shit together."
"2","Bomb deal with their all you can eat sushi. So many dishes and rolls to choose from for $22 bucks. Would definitely come back. Highly recommend their soft shell crab."
"2","I love it!   Yummy!!!!!   If you want some authentic amazing Guyanese and caribbean food, look no further!  The chicken roti is awesome!!!   The jerk chicken is amazing also!  I have been there many times and have loved it every time!  Wish they had dhal puri on their menu.  It's not fancy by any means, but it's  authentic Guyanese food!"
"2","I've been there once and loved it!  The fish tacos are delish and who doesn't like a nice little trip to NoDa?"
"1","Do not rent car dolly or anything that attach to your car. \n\nMy husband had to move his project car from garage to storage. He rented full size trailer. Some really young looking kid came out and hooked up the trailer to our truck. We went back to the house, got the car on the trailer and way to the storage... on West bound Grand Ave, the trailer locked up, tossed us all over the road, finally came off of hitch and rolled to other side of East bound lane (in front of Food City). \n\nScared the crap out of me. Luckly, car was fine and nobody got hurt. We had to get trailer towed to storage because it was still locked and our car was on the trailer. Somebody from Uhaul came and got the trailer the next day. When I got my bank statement, they charged us a lot more than what we originally signed for. They ended up charging us for 3 days and kept deposit too. After arguing with them numerous time, they refunded all but 1 day of charge. I think they shouldn't charge us at all since we couldn't use the trailer and we had to pay for towing too.\n\nThey were rude..."
"1","They're having a start up special, so I called to see how much their monthly dues are. The sales representative that picked up thought I was \""Sara\"" & was flat out rude; I finally convinced I wasn't Sara & he didn't even attempt to apologize. I asked how much his monthly dues were again & he had a cocky attitude as if I was annoying him. I asked for the manager & AJ picked up. AJ went straight into sales without acknowledging that the prior guy was wrong & would talk to him. I had to express the distaste that his sales rep left & asked if this how they treat potential clients? How do they treat their members once they've got their money? Don't you work on commission? AJ rebutted with that he'd \""try to find out\"" who the sales rep was & that I could come in for a tour. \n\nI'm going to go in & see if AJ is actually a manager, and if he has a name for me, so I can add this jerk's name to my review. \n\nI'm already a member at 24 hour fitness & Gold's, but I was looking for a gym a little closer to my house. I don't even want to give this location the credit for my sign up."
"1","I have always been a fan of Burlington's deals, however I will not be shopping at this one again. I went to return a belt... pretty simple. Instead, I stood in the customer service line for 15 minutes thanks to an employee of Burlington buying/putting things on layaway. It took three other staff to help her out. There were no words said to me except \""Hold on\"". I was pissed. When the lady was finally done, the employee at the service asked \""what do you want?\"" Serious help is needed there!\n If you work in the area of \""customer service\"" I think you should have some."
"1","This business is completely unprofessional.  I am a strong supporter of capitalism, which means that enterprises that do not make customers happy should not remain in business.  The market eventually sorts out the lousy businesses--like this one. \n\n  The people working here are very unprofessional.  When I get a massage, I don't want to hear the girls giving me a massage talking to their friends.  This is a workplace.  Be quiet.  We came here to relax, not to hear your banter.  So you get a failing mark on relaxation.  The massage is average to above average.  The presentation and decor of the place is \""bare bones.\""  After you get a massage and leave a tip, even a good tip, they always demand more.  It is very insulting and rude and it is poor customer service skills.  I will not be returning because there are a lot of other great opportunities in Vegas and one does not need to go to a foot massage spa that gives you pressure from a) workers talking during the massage and b) demanding a higher tip.  Save your money."
"2","Oh goodness I have been here before but it a been a while but the wings are amazing and there is not a bad seat in the house as far as watching the games ..nice friendly staff and plenty of seats even outside by the fire pit"
"2","We purchased my son's first Giant mtn bike here 2 years ago and just purchased a much more advanced bike for him recently. We are very pleased with the knowledge and customer service from the gang at BOP. This is a down-to-earth, friendly place with guys and gals who know all kinds of biking. The inventory is first rate and extensive as is the service from Joe, Laura, and their team. \n\nSide note: As we've been shopping here since they opened and have had only enjoyable experiences with them I was surprised to see some negative comments below; I would encourage you to speak to Joe about them to set them right; he's a great listener, open to customer input and all about good relationships and making new friends. \n\nThanks Joe, Laura and crew, you're the best!\n\nDan"
"2","Hana is a great place for sushi. For starters, the agadashi tofu bowl is fabulous & actually very filling! We ordered an array of rolls, all very fresh, but I was bummed we were one of the tables that didn't get it presented in a boat! Since it was very crowded, our dinner lasted until close which at that point we felt a bit rushed by the staff to head out. \n\nRegardless of that, the sushi was great & I love that it's BYOB."
"2","A great, home-town ice cream spot. (although townies will give you a hard time if you call it ice cream). No doubt you are getting a fun experience when you come here. They have everything you would come to expect from standard dips of custard in cones or bowls, to slushy-type drinks and their version of the DQ blizzard. \n\nI give it 4 stars and not 5 because it is not a great value. You will easily spend $5 for a couple scoop/dips of custard and it is hard to shell out that kind of cash when there is 50 cent soft-serve down the street. Also, it never fails to frustrate me that their will only take credit cards if your total order is over $10. So be prepared with cash unless you are buying for you group/family!"
"2","arrowhead grill is the only non-chain steakhouse in the west valley. it is a perfect spot for a real martini and a great delmonico steak. they have awesome specials almost everyday so call to ask or join the email list. recently they have had buy one get one free burgers, filets, delmonicos, prime rib, king crab legs.....definetly worth siging up for. they do bar specials during most sports games (suns, cardinals, coyotes) great alternative to boring bar food."
"1","I don't know why I bother with this store, every time I go in there my interaction with the staff that works there never smiles never days hi or thank u and whenever a customer or myself ask for something it's either deer in the headlights look or a look of sheer annoyance that they're being asked to do something. Well today was no better I went to use my 30% off coupon on a chair I knew the rules and made sure it wasn't on sale or anything else that wouldn't qualify it for the coupon . Gets run once and I get sorry it doesn't work did u load it right? Yes it's on there so he calls a manager, great but only to void the purchase and do it again. We run it again nothing so instead of calling a manager or even attempting to help I get a blank stare .. Ok fine your not to help or have the slightest interest in either helping me get the savings I'm entitled to or give me a reason why I can't use it for that purchase then ill go elsewhere not going back to this one ever again"
"2","Wow.  This was an awesome cheese steak.  The menu is really simple but if you want cheese steak this is it.  The cheese steaks were delicious and the service was great.  I don't live on this side of town but when out shopping near by i will be back for more."
"2","Checked this place out last night with a bunch of Twitter peeps and was really pleasantly surprised! It's got that slick downtown look but the kitchen is kicking some amazing pulled pork sliders! \nThey weren't the shredded up, over-sauced bit I've come to associate with pulled pork--these were closer to sliced pork, with a tangy cabbage/greens topping and were simply tasty. At $2, pretty darn big, too. I ruined mine by trying to eat with a knife and fork though; just hoist it up by hand, potential sauce stains be damned. Fries are crispy and well-seasoned too, and look to be hand cut.\nThe owner has a great backstory as well--I was told he went out of his way to hire people who were unemployed. Not transitioning to another job, but who had been looking unsuccessfully for work for months. Well, he sure picked the right ones because the food is great, the staff is friendly and the service is quick. This is going to be a lunchtime staple.\nAnd it's right off the seventh street station, so you don't have to futz about parking, but if you do, they validate?? Love!"
"1","Had to cancel my reservation 24 hours in advance of the date of arrival.  Well, read the fine print...this place is 48 hours in advance, and so the thieves took all my money for one night stay.....they'll just fill it in with some other guests.  A**hole!"
"2","A local casino catered to the Las Vegas residents. Reasonable buy-in at tables and not as crowded as the casinos on the strip."
"1","Horrible management, horrible staff. everyone is rude and unhelpful. \noh and my room smelled like poop the whole time. \nroom 1818 . dont stay there."
"1","I went here tonight with the BF to use a Groupon.... what a disappointment! I had heard that this place was so good... but really.... not awesome. The chips and salsa were ok, but not anything too special. I started with the supposedly amazing corn chowder.... bland and the chicken in it had a weird texture. Not my cup of tea... or soup, as it were. I ordered the double stack pork adovado enchiladas 'christmas' style... with green and red sauce. Well.... I'm not sure if there was any sauce on it.... there certainly wasn't any spice, I thought it was New Mexican food? No flavor or spice here. The pork was ok.... but again, not very flavorful. The BF just got a cheese crisp. It was soggy, flavorless, and pathetic. If it is an old family recipe, as the menu claims.... that family is probably pretty boring. To top it all off, the service was sloooow. I will not be back, sorry guys!"
"2","Kevin is so awesome. This spa is coming along so nice... Totally relaxing & affordable.... Highly recommend !!!!"
"2","I almost awarded them only three stars as they're the only establishment I encountered in my 5 day stay who seemed gave me any attitude. The food, however is what we went for and the food delivered. I highly recommend the Fig-Prosciuto flat-bread and the BF &B. The fried pickles and duck fat fries are very good as well.\n\nI was very unimpressed with the cavalier attitude given when they lost the credit card. No apology was offered when they discovered the card had indeed not made it back to the table (our server insisted she had returned it) and was instead on the floor between the register and restrooms."
"2","Super cute, old school Italian-American restaurant, replete with Christmas lights strung around the bar, very friendly wait staff and a killer beer/drink list. I didn't have pizza, but it looked good...Had the special veggie lasagna and a couple vodka drinks (they have Death's Door, among others) and the excellent garlic bread. The vibe is laid back- really homey. I could see making this a regular stop in the neighborhood. Others obviously agree because the place was packed on Saturday night."
"1","I wanted to post to see if others are experiencing the same issue I am. My wife purchased a gift card for a pair of custom jeans which I went in on April 11th to pick out. \n\nI found a material I liked which they had in stock and got fitted. I was told they would be ready in a month so where they will call me to get a final fitting. \n\nFast forward to this week where I get a call stating my jeans are not ready (2 months later). The excuses were they had machines go out,employees walk out AND the material I wanted was out of stock until 2 weeks ago. Huh?? Now the story is my jeans won't be ready for another 3-4 weeks. \n\nI am a business owner myself and I am the first to admit things don't always go as planned. BUT, I am very disappointed in Lawless and their communications. \n\nIf all the above is true, why didn't they let me know as they approached the original deadline and not 2 months later? Again, when I ordered the jeans the material was in front of me and in stock. If they ran out, where is my notification?\n\nWhen a company offers a \""custom\"" item at \""custom\"" prices, the level if service is expected to be high as well.\n\nThe gentleman I spoke to seemed apologetic and I understand he is not responsible but as an organization, someone has to be accountable. \n\nI will see how this all pans out but I'm not too hopeful. Will update on all activities."
"2","This place is the best!! The food is always amazing and the service is always great :) The chicken ciabatta is so good and I get it every single time I go with the french fries :) The spinach artichoke dip is also so good and it is a must :) we will always continue coming here :) (my dad says the ribs are incredible too)"
"1","Worst service u can ever imagine and what type of Mexican restaurant can't make guacamole because they ran out of tomatos?!?"
"1","Dined in. Spacious eating room. Where to stand in line to begin was not decipherable without staff direction. Samples of different\nmeats are available. Barbacoa and Carne Asada tacos were flavorful and generous on meat portions. Dining area and service stations were clean. \nNO prices given for drinks, ANY side dishes OR extras. Not even printed on provided hand menu or lit wall menus. A mystery until meal(s) rung up!"
"2","This place is awesome; a nice break from the strip, but still a great place with good music, cheap(er) drinks, a fun crowd, and a secret room you need a password for! There's an upstairs and a downstairs; I've been here one time where there was a line to get upstairs because it got too crowded. Downstairs has nice decor and plenty of seating, while upstairs has a big space to dance and heat lamps. \n\nFantastic local-ish place to check out; my favorite in downtown!"
"2","Do yourself a favor and bookmark this place.\n\nI love Palee's Crown and if you've seen my past reviews, you'd know I'm a tough cookie to please. I've had my fair share of Pad Thai and Spicy Basil garlic chicken and I must say that this is by far the best. No pad thai is EVER created equal, there is just no such thing. Restaurants typically have their own version of pad thai (albeit very similar, some are more saucy while other are more dry) but this one suits my palette the best, with just the right balance of tamarind and fish sauce to make a yummy saucy base. I stumbled upon this place after denouncing Benjarong as one of my favs ever since it went through what seemed like an eternity of renovations, I just gave up.... But that's another story.   When I want quality thai, Palee's is it. I'm the only \""ethnic\"" one in my office so introducing my coworkers to new foods is a challenge. Of all the Thai places I've taken them to, they always vote for PC. And whenever my mom is in town she ALWAYS wants to go to PC.  There's just too many things to like about this place. For one, aside from the quality, the location is good since it's located in close proximity to a lot of businesses (hotels, the fiesta mall, etc). Second, the quality is excellent. Third, the price is competitive and on par with a lot of local thai joints in the area. \n\n......And last but surely not the least, did I mention the cute and friendly hostesses/servers? Seriously, it's like watching an episode of Cheers every time I come here, \""sometimes you want to go, where everybody knows your name\""!  Great customer service!\n\n\n\nAnd to everyone who is rating this place as a $$ instead of a $.... WTH are you  ordering? Lunch plates are usually $8 while the standard size is no more than $10 per person."
"1","Meh. The selection here was mediocre. I used to remember loving J Crew in high school. The quality and design has really gone downhill over the many seasons. They used to have great finds in the clearance section and now when I browse... I think that there is a reason why this thing is marked 90% off and still on the racks!!!"
"2","This place is pretty good if you like cheap, quick chinese food.  I love the General Chicken.  You have to watch out because they tend to make it all pretty spicy.  The price is very cheap and they give quick service.  I would recommend it for take out not eat at the place."
"2","This place is great. Our son was born without his right hand and we had a prosthesis made for him. The process was fast! The staff was very friendly and helpful. More than satisfied with this clinic! \n\nWill continue to receive services from this location."
"2","I arrived in Las Vegas pretty damn late on a Friday night.  By the time I checked into my hotel and got to the Bellagio, it was already midnight.  I was hungry and needed food badly, and Caf\u00e9 Bellagio was the only restaurant open that late.  \n\nBeing that it was so late, I didn't want to pig out, so I decided to share the Crab Cakes Benedict with my friend( http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/V0tAJLQlgYNCWAj5di3AoQ/l ).  The crab cakes were huge!  Instead of an English muffin, the crab cakes were on a bed of crispy hash browns.  The dish was really good, and it definitely satisfied my late night hunger.  \n\nThe service here was good.  We were seated right away, our food came out fast, and our server was very friendly.  This is definitely a good spot to cure the munchies!"
"1","I went here for an eyebrow wax and a pedicure and I definitely came out in more pain than when I went in (sure that's not what spas are for?!?). Anyway one of my eyebrows is really badly burned and swollen. I also got one of my toes knicked by the clippers which really hurt but the girl didn't even seem that fussed by. Oh and two of my toes came out bleeding at the bottom of the nail. The girls in the spa are friendly enough most of the time (although at other times very  miserable) but the quality of the treatments has gone seriously downhill. I used to go here once a month for a few years as a treat to myself so feel I am in a good position to now judge how poor everything has got. It definitely feels more like a conveyor belt."
"1","We visited for my birthday yesterday, and this was not the same experience that we had months before.  The service was absolutely awful and near non-existent.  The waiter didn't come to check on us or refill our drinks.  I had to hunt for the waiter and flag him down to ask for every drink refill.  Half of our party ordered bottomless bloody marys, which were also difficult to obtain.  The waiter didn't know which vodkas were included, and didn't offer to find out and when I asked about the salted rim he simply said we don't have any today.  This was an absolutely shocking dining experience compared with our visit from 6 months prior.  I'm so disappointed because I used to love this place and rave about it to all my friends and yelp buddies."
"2","Been going to Dr. Josh since our girl Tiffany was a baby. She just turned 14 last month. Late last year she developed a cancerous cyst in her mouth and it wasn't looking like she'd see Christmas let alone her 14th birthday. With some very delicate surgery, several rounds of chemo and a ton of from Josh and his awesome staff, Tiff is still with us and we'll be forever thankful to have them all in our lives. They care. That matters. Would highly recommend them."
"1","Had dinner here last week because i had a coupon for $20.00 I was pretty hungry, but to my surprise the food wasn't even good. I didn't eat much because the quality of the food didn't taste good to me at al. I just wasted my money eating here. I wouldn't eat here again."
"1","Prive, if you are trying to emulate and recreate the worst aspects of LA douchebaggery, with the added bonus of really bored-looking scantily-clad girls dancing on tables, then mission accomplished!  This place really, really brings out some serious retards.  It's like a big club in the middle of Glendale with a dance floor full of car salesmen and rug merchants.  This place is the worst.\n\nThe bartenders and servers in the VIP room were very nice, hence why it gets 2 stars, but that's it.  The bouncers are completely awful and useless, so yeah nice hires on that front.\n\nStay in your room, call your friends over, and have a better time with Fox News on in the background, because as much as I hate it, it's better than listening to some chump DJ try to mix \""Barbie Girl\"" with like Creed or whatever."
"2","This place is so delicious...Seriously, it's one of my favorite restaurants in the \""West Coast-ish\"" area. The boyfriend and I went here on our trip to Vegas this past March and I loved this place so much that he recently took me to the one in New York. I didn't love my food at the New York location as much as I loved my food at the Vegas one. Seriously, it was just that good. After our delicious dinner (accompanied with wine and dessert) we went to the lounge/club area upstairs. I remember it was a Thursday night and there weren't too many people at the club but I still had a great time. Lavo brings back so many wonderful food and dancing memories that I would recommend it to everyone going to Vegas."
"2","We decided to come to Tommy V's because of some of the reviews from Yelp friends.  I don't know if I should thank you or curse you,  I am supposed to still be on my Hcg diet, so I was not having anything.  However, my hubby decided he was doing the Restaurant Week dinner.  It looked amazing, so I took a little bite of his beet salad, ohh, perfectly roasted golden and red beets with arugula and goat cheese.  Then he had the Eggplant Torta, OMG, it reminded me of the Melanzana (italian for the Eggplant Torta) my daddy and I used to make on Sundays, I had three bites.  Then it came the Lemon Torte, my willpower caved and I had to have two bites.  I guess I will have to go on the treadmill a little longer this week.  Michael behind the bar was fantastic.  I had a taste of a few wines before settling for the Heavyweight Cabernet.  Zoran, stopped by to say hello, we have something in common, he also has twins.   \nI can't wait to come back with friends and have the Eggplant Torta again."
"1","Went to TJ's tonight and got a couple large pizzas. Food was good, a lot better than your typical Dominos or Little Caesars. Guy was nice, took the order, got it right. Nothing really beyond that. We got some coffees from the gas station next door while we waited, that was nice. I might go here again simply because I like to shop local, but all in all I would have to say it was just okay. Maybe I'll give the wings a shot next time..."
"2","Great place! the food was  good,and so was the saki. The deep fried whole fish with the sauted vegies was awsome. Some of the fish for the sushi i don't think it was that fresh.(being a chef helps knowing whats good or not). The prices were on the very high side. Hope they give bigger portions."
"1","Had some food delivered. Unbelievable. I threw most of the food out. The bun for the brisket was all wet from condensation inside the box. The meat was dry and tasted old. I tried eating a little with the BBQ sauce and that helped a little. The mac and cheese was OK. The green beans overcooked. Baked beans were OK. Potato salad was put thru a food processor with small pieces of potato--awful. Never again!!\nI almost forgot---the Chinese salad had wilted lettuce and canned oranges. Do people actually eat this stuff????"
"2","My husband and I went for lunch here and we loved it! It's located in a great location uptown and the service was great! My husband enjoyed the wings and I had a fantastic sandwich! Can't wait to go back and experience during dinner."
"2","SSSOOOOO excited to check this place out when I heard they sell Intelligentsia Coffee. I've only been twice (two days in a row...heh) and was more then happy with both visits. The espresso sells itself, they use Trader Joe's almond milk, free wifi, and the baristas are super friendly and accommodating. The space is quaint, a couple tables and couches, and you can't tell that it's a place that buys gold at all. I even saw a Settlers of Catan game board! \n\nThe only downfall is that they have no sign, which makes it extremely difficult to find; there's only a \""We Sell Gold\"" sign out front. However, we were told by the barista that they are in the process of changing signs.\n\nThis is a must for all coffee-lovers in AZ!"
"1","Well............\n\nThe fish is fresh. The servers are pleasant, however take extremely long to get your drinks and let your sushi sit ready for about 10 minutes  at the bar before being brought to you. We had a party of 4, and all ordered our individual rolls; however they were not served at the same time. I was the last to get my food and everyone else was done eating. To top it off, the rolls were small, really small. \n\nIf you have time to kill, go here. If you like small rolls, go here. \n\nI'd say the only good thing about this place is that it does taste good and the fish is fresh. That's it. I don't understand the hype about this place."
"1","Great looking place with mediocre food and high prices.  The quality to price ratio is so low here that I cannot recommend it.  The staff has been snooty to me and the food is just not worthy of the reputation it seems to have among locals. Save\nYour money and go elsewhere."
"2","On the days when I pick up my daughter from North Phoenix, we typically go for ice cream of some sort. More often than not, we end up at Desert Ridge Mall, where we encounter Puro Gelato.\n\nThe selection is good, having at least 20 different flavors of gelato/sorbet. The portions are nice, as well. We never get more than a small (one scoop), though they do have four different sizes.\n\nCompared to other gelatos I've sampled, Puro's is decent. It is definitely delicious. It's extremely light and fluffy...though, it's not as thick as some of the confections at other places we've sampled.\n\nIf you're at Desert Ridge and you're looking for a decent frozen treat, you should try Puro Gelato. It's by far the best option from which to choose at the mall."
"1","Might want to chalk this one up to an off day, but I ordered from here on a Sunday night, and it was pretty bad.\n\nPizza was cheesy, so that's good, but unfortunately also saucy. That's not a compliment when it comes to pizza. There was way too much sauce and it had a weird taste to it. Kind of like Ragu pasta sauce, which I only know the taste of from eating dinner at non-Italian friends' houses when I was young. A taste I wish I could forget. The crust was thick and bready, which can be good if done right, but this one was underdone and didn't have any crispiness to it. The flaccid slices caused the cheese to slide off in a rather unattractive manner. I don't think flaccid is ever a compliment in any context, anyway.\n\nWe also got wings, and the skin was kinda slimy and chewy...again, no crispiness. Maybe they were rushed and were undercooking everything that night? Their hot wing sauce is dark and sticky with lots of hot pepper flakes, not a classic orangey-red buffalo sauce, so I didn't like that much either. They were very, very spicy, thanks to the hot pepper, but didn't have much depth of flavor beyond that. They don't have celery, so I had nothing to cool down my mouth from the intense spiciness. And the bleu cheese was just packet dressing, so the taste wasn't appealing enough to drown my wings in it (like I do at Fuel & Fuddle, which also does not have celery, but makes up for it with an amazing homemade dressing).\n\nIt was fairly cheap, delivery was quick. If you're not picky about pizza, it's fine. Pizza is one of my favorite foods, so I'm not going to settle for a mediocre to bad one, especially when the wings weren't good either. Probably not ordering from here again. Onto the next pizzeria!"
"2","I am sure I have written a review for this place before but think it's worth updating it. \n\nThis is by far one of my favourite restaurants in Edinburgh. And anywhere really. I'll tell you why...\n\nFirstly, the food is always outstanding. I typically go chicken or prawn panang. It's gorgeous. And sometimes gaeng massaman. Also gorgeous. I've tried a few of their stir-frys which are equally as lovely and I think once Pad Thai...always yummy. But in a thai restaurant like this I tend to steer clear of Pad Thai as there's so many gorgeous dishes. I like to try a different starter each time I go and I have never been disappointed. \n\nSecondly, Everything always tastes fresh and flavourful. I find the portions to be slightly large unless I'm sharing with someone. Between a starter and main you're stuffed. \n\nThirdly, I tend to eat here once a month, sometimes twice because of the above (and I love Thai food) but mainly for the fact that the owner and staff are just absolutely lovely. They always greet us warmly and the ones that recognise us always ask how we are. I have been bringing my son (7 now) here since he was 4 and they are as happy to receive him now as they were then. And they often give him a free kids ice-cream because they are just awesome like that. Not once have I ever been uncomfortable eating there with my son. They never made me feel awkward or badly for when he was messier and louder. They have always been brilliant. \n\nFourthly, to expand on my previous point they so obviously love their local repeat customers. I just recently went for dinner here for my birthday. The owner who had come over to chat with us asked what we were celebrating and when I told him he graciously offered is desserts on the house :) who would mind that?! (Just to point out it there was only 2 of us)\n\nFifthly, I don't love their dessert selection and I LOVE dessert. But I don't care as I'm too full from the amazing starter and mains. However I had the lemon sorbet and that was really nice. Came in a real frozen lemon as well! \n\nSo that's my love of Phuket Pavillion in 5 crucial points I suppose. I could talk about their prices but let's be realistic...Thai food in Edinburgh is pricey. And there's a few better known places that have the worst service and average food that charge the same or more (chaopraya for one)."
"2","A solid 4 stars for Mt. Lebanon's WG location.  Highlights were the Strawberry Balsamico Salad and the Caramelized Walnut Ball for dessert.  \n\nThe decor is comfortable.  The atmosphere is casual.  The service was good.  \n\nI will definitely return."
"2","Amazing! Fresh ingredients you watch them make your food in front of you. Tender flaky crust, a must try in Mesa."
"1","I have been ordering from King Wok for over a year now. The food very good however the service is TERRIBLE. I swear they NEVER get my order right (for take out or delivery). I've given them a year to fix their crappy service so I won't be ordering from them anymore."
"2","By far the best Hawaiian restaurant I've been to so far; delicious and authentic. I loved the service, the food and the atmosphere. I don't normally write reviews, but this place deserves a good one. I had kalua pig and cabbage, and some poke, they were delicious. If you want good authentic hawaiian food, this is the place to go to."
"2","This was great!  We went in and got a large variety of what was in the bins in the front.  5 stars for the squid salad.  When walking out, I heard the woman who was ordering ask if they had everything on the menu, not just what was out and the man behind the counter said yes.  Kind of bummed to not know that before, especially since we ordered about 8 different things, you would think he would have offered us more variety.  Overall very delicious."
"2","I have collared shirts, workouts shits, and even a couple pairs of shoes from this place. Very affordable way to upgrade your wardrobe. Yes, it's used clothing but most of it tends to be in very good condition.  The store isn't very big and can be hit or miss IME but there are good deals to be had. \n\n I would recommend checking it out if you're in the area. Combine with a trip to Nordstrom Rack nearby and you should find some good clothes between the two."
"1","Biblos is the kind of place that you walk past all the time, never having any inclination of entering, but then somehow end up there. There is nothing particularly appealing about Biblos from the outside. We are always on the hunt for wifi, and Biblos unabashedly welcomed us inside, albeit desperately and in the absence of any hint of self-respect (see: Budweiser tattoo above door).\n\nUpon entering, we sat in what was undoubtedly the sole appealing aesthetic of the place: a cozy library-esque nook with big armchairs and shelves lined with books. Maybe they could have pulled off that kind of atmosphere if it weren't for the abrasive lighting and large flat screen television mounted directly above the Charles Dickens novels. This place might have -- maybe -- appeared hip and progressive circa 2002. As you sit there, numbly staring at the large posters obstructing what would otherwise be an interesting window view of Nicolson Street, and another one of the least memorable (and rightly so) hits of the early millennium rolls on without hesitation, you may find yourself wondering what life choices you have made to predestine your visit to this establishment. \n\n\""Hey guys, look! All food 25% off! What could go wrong!\"" you might say. Nothing weird about that, right? We got the nachos and the restaurant's eponymous salad. The nachos were sloppily thrown together, with globs of guacamole, sour cream, and what they referred to as salsa clumped into the center of the chips, although I can't say they tasted terrible - but then again, what can go wrong with cheese and chips. At least we cleared the whole plate. The same sadly cannot be said for the Biblos salad. \n\nAs for the drinks, they were the most acceptable aspect of Biblos we saw on that fateful evening. We got a Pi\u00f1a Colada and a Dark 'n' Stormy, both of which were decent (don't get excited). One upside: if you have a student ID, there are quite a few discounts on drinks, and both were of reasonable size considering the mere \u00a33.70 we had to shell out.\n\nUltimately, I guess you get what you pay for at Biblos, and I mean that in a bad way. There are deals to be had here, but best to spend your money elsewhere."
"2","I can't believe I never before wrote a review of Haji-Baba.  I've literally been going here with varying regularity for most of my life.  I have probably tried most of the menu and never ever had a bad experience, but will admit that I probably fall back on the falafel sandwich more than half the time I go to Haji-Baba.  It really is the best falafel in town.\n\nAdditional tip, pick up some decadent baklava (several varieties) or other freshly made Mediterranean pastries and a package of the best pitas in town, along with some other ethnic groceries on your way out.  My promise: you will be happy to know about this place once you try it out."
"1","Just OK. Better options out there. Seems a little tired....Firebirds has better food and prices."
"1","Those of you who have read my review of sportsclips know I like the concept and frequent the chain monthly.  I even have come here before and had good experiences with another stylist.  However, my most recent visit was horrendous.  From the greeting to the end, I was disappointed but mostly with the final product.  Here is what happened.  1) I arrived and even though I was the only one there besides those already seated, I had to wait while the girls chatted with each other.  Then the stylist came over and took me to her station.  Of all the girls I have had cut my hair at a sportsclips, this one was the worst.  She didn't even try to engage me in conversation.  I asked her to style my hair the way I always get it done, 1 1/2 on the sides and fingers pressed on top with blending.  She tried to convince me her fingers were really small and I should get higher but I told her I wanted it short.  When she first told me she was finished, there were at least two finger lengths and it was uneven. Probably the worst I have seen.  I learned a long time ago to speak up or end up with unhappy cuts so I told her and she gave me a bit of resistance before trying to cut it shorter. I don't know if she didn't want to get close to her fingers or didn't care but she still didn't get it right.  Even through the massage and shampoo I got the feeling she had no interest in her job, client or anything but the final paycheck.  I still gave her my normal tip which is pretty generous and she didn't even say thank you or come back again.\n\nI give it two stars because I have had other stylists here who have been better and I do like the sports screens and the hot (and now cold) towel treatment.\n\nI wish I remembered her name, I remember only that I sat in the second seat from the rear on the left side of the store if you face the rear.\n\nOh, and if anyone cares, it has been almost a month and it grew in horribly uneven."
"1","Ew,  I recently moved to this area and this is now my local Dairy Queen.  Who knew you could mess up a Blizzard so bad?\n\nFirst of all, the line was out the door.  We assumed that it was just a busy night.  Turns out they were out of multiple items (and did not put a sign up). People were upset and walking out.  Then the family in front of us ordered, but did not pay.  No card, no money left their hand.  What?  So like you are giving out free ice cream and making us wait in line?  \n\nI get up to the counter and ask a question about the ingredients of a Brownie Batter blizzard.  They are like, it is just brownies.  My response: Anything else?  They had to go ask someone.  What?  Seriously?!  So I finally get my answer and order it.  My husband also ordered a blizzard.  He ordered a Turtle Pecan blizzard and received some random peanuts in his blizzard.  We never got a receipt.  When I asked for one, they said they did not have any.  What?!\n\nWe pay and wait.  And wait.  Oh, but while we wait, we get to watch the kitchen person.  He was making a chicken sandwich.  With his LONG ponytail hanging over the grill.  Yum?  More like gross.  Then both my husband and I notice that he grabbed a raw chicken breast (while not wearing a glove) and placed it on the bare counter.  He then wiped his hand on his pants.  What?  Salmonella much?  Any food standards?\n\nWe get our medium blizzards.  The ice cream normally extends to the top or slightly over the top of the cup.  This time the ice cream barely made it to the top of my cup. My husband had ice cream under the cup.  When we asked if this was a medium, they said yes.  And just walked away.  \n\nI walked out feeling very unsatisfied and my husband I determined this will be our last visit to the local DQ.  Besides the poor service, the food standards were disgusting."
"2","They are now under new management and completely remodeled the inside. It's fantastic! Fast, quick service with brand new massage chairs and I loved their background music. They also have a new discount card program. Get your nails done 8 times and receive $8 off your next service. I'm happy it's so close to work and I can be in and out within a lunch hour."
"2","The best Dr. in the world!  I have been taking all three of my dogs to Dr. Mauro their whole lives.  I can't tell you how many times she has saved their lives.  Dedicated, compassionate and really loves animals!  Don't know what I would do without her and her staff.  She really cares and loves the animals she takes care of.  She has been there for us for the past 15 years."
"2","great service, fantastic food"
"1","Decent place, not my favorite casino. The rooms are nice, though not very clean. We had food stuck to our ceiling. Additionally you are charged a resort fee for things they know you won't use. Who uses the gym in Vegas? They only allow wifi connections in room for one device. Not worth the ridiculous resort fee per night."
"1","The only reason they are getting 2 stars is because the promoters are awesome; they were always so nice and eager to get my friends and I in and take care of us with free drinks.  However, the bouncers inside the club and the club in general = not cool.\n\nThe dance floor gets SUPER crowded with lots of creepy guys who just stand there taking up space staring at the girls.  Like at least move to the bar and watch...don't take up space on the floor.\n\nI was told to stop dancing \""like that\"" because I was dropping my booty and they said it was inappropriate; like really?! I easily pointed out 5 other people doing much worse (even some girl giving a guy a bj at one of the tables!) and they proceeded to kick my friends and I out because I was being difficult. Mind you, I had not been drinking at all so I wasn't drunk and arguing, I was just annoyed.\n\nThey have tried bringing my friends and I back every time we walk by but I can honestly say I will NEVER EVER EVERRRR be returning to this place.  So rude!"
"2","Admittedly, this place is a bit pricey for the food that you get. However, I am always satisfied with the quality of burger, the beautiful display of the food, and I can never get enough of the fries. The location (right inside Planet Hollywood) is spectacular. If you're willing to spend a few extra bucks for a great burger, then I'd definitely recommend BurGR. \n\nIf you like eggs (particularly ones with runny yolk), especially if you've never gotten an egg with your burger... You MUST get the farm burger, hands down. I've gotten this all 3 times I've been here, and it's never disappointed. The meat is juicy, tender, and flavorful. As for fries, I prefer the truffle fries -- the truffle sauce is simply spectacular. My mouth is watering even as I think about it. If you can, just slather as much sauce as you can and then ask for more. I've asked for seconds (and thirds) of the sauce before.\n\nNOTE: If you're aiming to get in at a reasonable time, particularly on busy Vegas weekends, I would start waiting in line even before it opens... Otherwise, it's not quite worth the wait. Last time I was there, we arrived around 30 minutes after opening and had to wait about an hour to be seated."
"2","Great selection and wide variety with good prices make this my new favorite Asian/international market in Madison! Store and items were clean and fresh. Variety of ethnicities-- I went home with Jamaican, Mexican, Indian, Arab, Thai, and Chinese foods/products in my bags! Near downtown and very close to the beltline make it easy to access, even if you're coming from out of town. Seems like the strip mall and library which share a parking lot with Yue-Wah has all been recently updated. Looks nice."
"2","Great attention to detail. Full service from the welcome at door, a complementary water bottle, to the getting the works for a pedicure!! Great place and will return!"
"2","Went for lunch. Food and service was great. Definitely will be my favorite place to go."
"2","We discovered this restaurant on my Yelp app after looking for a new place for lunch in the Summerlin area.  I loved the shabby chic vintage look of the place and the very friendly waiters.  This place has almost a romantic feel to it and it's a very nice change from everything else in this city.  \n\nHubby and I ordered a couple of flat breads and the burger.  They all were delicious and we gave our best to eat slow and enjoy.  \n\nLiving in North Las Vegas, I'm sad that all the nice places are so far away from us.  But we will definitely keep this place in mind for next time we make a day trip to Summerlin."
"1","I really do enjoy this place. It's close to my work and in the middle of downtown Phoenix.  The staff is very friendly and the service is quite fast.  This past visit though didn't leave me as happy as I normally would be.\n\nI've ordered their burgers and fries before, which I really enjoyed and especially for the price.  Today, I opted for hot dogs with a side of potato salad.  That sounded good to me so that is what I ordered but sadly, all I got were 2 incredibly dinky hot dogs.  For $2.75 each, I was not too pleased.  Even if if had included any toppings, the dog itself was a very small/thin dog.  Had it been a thin snappy dog, (dirty water dog) I could see past it but it wasn't.  The potato salad though was very good\n\n I think I will stick to the burgers from now on."
"2","My first trip here, very clean and I love the aluminum chairs! The food was hot and fresh and I love their special sauce too. TOAST!"
"2","Great happy hour prices and man how I love me some Pork Canitas tacos"
"1","The sushi here tasted like grocery store sushi, which really bummed me out because we drove pretty far to eat here. The service was excellent and everyone was very friendly. I had a roll called gone with the wind which was supposed to have avacado, but there was no avacado, it was substituted with asparagus, which I did not care for. All the rolls I ate were dried out tasting"
"1","update; their food effing sucks... so far i've tried the chicken salad with pita bread and the grilled chicken salad, both were pre-made sitting in a cooler... the chicken salad had about as much flavor as my vitamins i take everyday and the grilled chicken on my salad was tough and unpleasant... i will not get another 9 dollar peice of crap meal here ever again."
"2","Excellent food and service.   Busy Friday night, and waters were regularly filled and our server was alway near by.  \n\nThe BBQ spring rolls, grilled cheese and fried chicken sliders were amazing.  The fried s'more was simply over the top.  A must order!"
"1","Want to make a grown man sob like a baby?  Tell him that the steak is so good at CUT that it ruined you for any steak thereafter....then take him to CUT and watch as he licks his lips, takes a long sip of his expertly chosen Bordeaux and eagerly slices into his $130 piece....of fat and grizzle.\n\nThen have the waiter smash some glasses on two of your guests and focus on cleaning the mess instead of apologizing to them.\n\nThen clear my plate while my back is turned so I can't ask the waiter if the guest chef tonight is smoking crack.\n\nWill I give them a second chance?  Of course.  Will I get psyched up before I go?  Not this guy.  CUT is a serious place so I'll chalk all this up to a \""series of unfortunate events\""."
"2","I'm a big fan and promoter of Raku and have probably more than 50% my friends to come here if not for a full dinner, at least for their Agedashi Tofu.  I always describe it as the best Agedashi tofu I have ever had in my life.  So I came here this past weekend just for a light late night snack ordering their foie gras, foie gras custard, bacon wrapped tomatoes and of course their Agedashi tofu.  All the dishes were great and as I remembered from the last few times I visited, but the Agedashi tofu was off for once.  It was not silky smooth on the inside as it normally is.  Hopefully that was just a one time quality control thing.  Overall it was still a great experience and I would still recommend everyone to come here just to try their Agedashi tofu if nothing at all."
"2","Bill's is awesome in a weird kind of way. The rooms are surprising good, but the bathroom sucks. How much are you going to spend in the bathroom seriously. Ladies - sorry, this won't work for you if you are high maintenance or take three hours to get ready. \n\nDrinking the casino margaritas for $2 are good, they were better when they were $1. I'd stay here in a heartbeat. I've stayed at most of the Las Vegas properties (work) so this is a solid place. \n\nSpring/Summer tip: You can use the Flamingo pool because Bill's doesn't have one. \n\nEnjoy!"
"2","Great bar/lounge!  Cozy atmosphere with candles and fireplaces, friendly staff, good-looking but chill crowd, and good drinks at reasonable prices."
"2","This is my second review of Papaya Thai.  The first was brutal, I'd ordered Phad Thai, a personal favorite, and got a mush of cooked carrot and cilantro over noodles that were to the point of becoming paste.  I was really disappointed, as they are the only thai place remotely close to my house.\n\nHowever, today I woke up feeling rather brave and hungry.  It's been several months, so I ventured back and ordered the same dish.  this time making sure to ask them to hold the carrots and cilantro.  And lo and behold, my dish was tasty.  It was sooo much better, I almost suspect it's under new management, or perhaps a different chef.  It's still not one of my top picks, but the service was good, the wait was short, and I was able to enjoy one of my favorite dishes without driving an hour to get it.  \n\nOverall, I'm both surprised and pleased by the difference.  Whatever changes they've made since my last visit were definitely for the best, and if they're permanent, I wouldn't hesitate to go back."
"1","I love Dominoes, and I USUALLY like this location, but I will not be ordering from this store again after tonight. We spent $30 on two pizzas and stuffed cheesy bread, and both pizzas were prepared wrong. The pizza we ordered for our children was supposed to be half pepperoni and half bacon... and they skipped the bacon entirely. Our pizza should have been Italian sausage and black olives... And they didn't put on any sausage. I also paid the stupid extra fee for a cup of marinara sauce for the cheesy bread... No marinara. All of this could have been solved nicely if the manager had simply gotten on the phone when we called and helped right the wrongs... But he didn't. He yelled at his employee from across the room what to say to us and made the poor kid be the middle man for the whole conversation. Refused to refund us or do anything to remedy the situation. Sorry Dominoes. You lost four customers today."
"2","My wonderful stay began at check-in. While standing in line, I noticed an area for M Life members and wondered why that line was shorter than the one I was standing in. If you've never been to MGM Grand, they have huge screens behind the check-in desk that flash various attractions in the hotel. A \""commercial\"" for M Life just happened to show and said check out Mlife.com. I figured I should check it out right then and there on my phone.\n\nIn the span of 5 minutes, I became a member of M Life and secured a lower hotel room rate for my stay! The best part was the front desk employee who honored my new reservation. I saved $100 just by joining M Life.\n\nMy hotel room was decent (view totally sucked, but who cares since I saved $100). The beds were comfortable and clean. I thoroughly enjoyed the pool area (stayed out there for four hours and was probably in the lazy river for an hour). The tube rental price, however, should be a little less ($16 for the day, but it goes down to $10 after 1 p.m.)\n\nMy only negative is the shower. The water temperature was fine the first day; the second day it took a few before it warmed up. On the third day, however, it never warmed up. We called maintenance and within a few minutes, the water began warming up. I'm not sure if they control the water temperature remotely, but a maintenance person did show up to fix a problem that seemed to correct itself.\n\nI absolutely LOVE the toiletries! They have the best smelling lotion out of any hotel I've ever stayed in. I also enjoyed the shampoo and conditioner.\n\nBreakfast buffet is fabulous. If you go right before they are about to switch over for lunch, you'll get to taste some great food as well. I almost forgot about Fat Tuesdays downstairs. If you love to drink, stop by here, buy a refillable container and drink away (don't forget the extra shot for $1!)\n\nThis is my third time staying here and I don't see any reason to stay anywhere else -- unless the room is free!"
"2","Great food, atmosphere and friendly staff.  My favorite food there is the shrimp tempera.  Will be going back for more!"
"1","Usually we really enjoy eating at Fatburger.  The last two visits have left us disappointed....The place is not crowded and yet our food comes out warm.  No excuse when ours is the only order being made.  Tonight not only were the burgers just warm, they were extremely salty and even the fries were not the usual piping hot.  Not sure why the quality is going down, but we will be trying other burger places for a while."
"1","Vegas Yelpers!\n\nI'm always on a hunt for red velvet pancakes!\n\nCame here the other day with my boys Supercr3w/Jabbawockeez for Rainen's birthday breakfast. They are good friends with the owner Baja. Baja is super friendly and took really good care of us.\n\nThis is a hard review because the owner was amazing nice... but the red velvet pancakes... didn't pass my approval!\n\nI ordered the red velvet pancakes... with egg whites, chicken sausage and potatoes. I didn't care for their version of red velvet pancakes! I was bummed out and only ate a quarter of it. Something was missing in their recipe... I had better. My friends cousin also didn't like her order of red velvet pancakes... and only took a bite of it. The rest of my breakfast was doable... hard to mess up right?!\n\nI won't be back unless it's with the boys... if so I'll have to try the chocolate pancakes and update my review.\n\nCan't complain... I only paid... tip... Baja took care of us.\n\nAs for the red velvet pancakes... Sorry. Fail.\n\nCasual indoor dining. Check it out and lmk what you think."
"1","I really wanted to like this place, with its highly-reviewed American food and cute signature steer. Unfortunately, the service was sub-par. First of all, service was slow and aloof. They were out of the nightly special (Fish & Chips), but we didn't find this out until five minutes after we ordered. Then, we had to practically hunt down the server to re-order and remind her that we were still waiting for our drinks (this is at least 20 minutes after we arrived). Contrary to the previous reviews, I didn't think the fries were as great as people said they were. The burger was OK but I've had much better for a cheaper price, nothing amazing here. And apparently you're supposed to get your soft drink in a frosty mug? Nope - more a tiny glass with a few cubes of ice (plus no refill offered when I finished it quickly). I know this place is low-key and I know the demands of working in a busy restaurant but come on.... service counts!"
"2","Was looking for a conveniently located nail salon near the Strip where I live and found this place on Yelp. When I arrived, I immediately recognized the location as I have previously given a ride to a friend there. The service was great and the price was right! The only way to make it better is to have LA prices. But the manicure and pedicure package is a very good deal. Mai is my favorite person there so ask for her when you go. Plus having all the great restaurants nearby in Chinatown is a bonus. Especially Pho Kim Long and Tofu Hut."
"2","We switched our hotel to Polo Towers over Super Bowl weekend based on a Groupon, and we are really happy we did. We were somewhat skeptical because it was a discounted room and there are some negative reviews on yelp, but we found the Studio to be a perfect size, clean, and comfortable. \n\nThe Murphy bed was no problem whatsoever. The fridge was empty (thank you), and there was a full-on coffee maker (not a tiny cheap one). Friendly staff, a nice convenience store with decent coffee/bagels. We'd definitely stay here again.\n\nThey did bring up the opportunity to upgrade our room in exchange for the timeshare discussion, but the guy wasn't pushy at all and we never heard about it again."
"1","Slow service, rude staff, and I sat in a drive thru (at the window - no one in front of me) for 20 minutes while the staff argued amongst themselves about where the salted caramel topping was placed and by whom. When I asked about my drink, the staff member said \""You have to pay first\"" and when I politely told her I paid 20 minutes ago, she closed the window, rolled her eyes, and yelled at another staff member to \""deal with this idiot.\"" I. Will. Never. Go. Back."
"2","First things first, so you don't get it twisted:\n\nI'm kinda a Luke's girl...or Al's girl...Joey's girl...DeFalco's girl...Chicago Burger Company's girl...ok, I guess it's time to face it. I'm an Italian beef sandwich whore.  I don't think I've met one that I didn't like. And now that this place is really close to work, I'm adding Portillo's to my dance card...\n\nYesterday a couple of folks from the office ordered takeout from there...I've been trying to be a good girl and avoid eating out everyday for lunch, but I finally broke down and said \""Yes\"" to the mess. \n\nI ordered an Italian beef sandwich with EVERYTHING (how do you know if you REALLY LOOOOVE your new beau if you don't get to know every nook and cranny?) with \""gravy\"" on the side...bless their hearts, they put my grilled onions and mozzarella (all melty and seductive-like) on the sandwich to go and put my \""gravy\"", giardiniera, and peppers on the side...BRILLIANT! \n\nWhen I got my sandwich, it was P-E-R-F-E-C-T-oh, no sloppy, soppy mess that had been sitting or congealing for the 10 minute commute to tummy-town. I was able to decorate my vittles as I saw fit. The cheese fries were deliciously crispy crinkle cut fries that I was able to dip in the decadent, hot cheesy/jalapeno sauce. And to wash it all down? Sure I could've continued my quest for good-girl status and had water or a V8 but NO! I washed it down with a frosty, cold, bubbly root beer...and I was in heaven."
"1","Upon entering, there were two ladies in front of me ordering take-out.  A gentleman, possibly the manager, behind the counter said, \""Welcome to Cici's\"" and then walked away while the young lady at the register told me it would be a couple of minutes. The women in front of me finished ordering and the lady at the register stood there for a long time just looking at the register. Shecalled the manager over for help with something, he left and she continued to stare at the register. As I stood there, according to my watch, almost FIVE minutes had a passed since I entered the restaurant. She did not look up or acknowledge me again. I walked out the door, never being helped, paying or eating. If there is a problem in making me wait to take my money at Cici's, what other issues does this restaurant have?"
"2","Phenomenal cakes by a baker as sweet as her desserts! The BEST Carrot Cake and German Chocolate Cake I have EVER had! The cake stays very moist even days after being in the refrigerator. The Carrot Cake is heavenly and the German Chocolate is perfection (not too rich like most German Chocolate Cakes can be). I can't rave enough about Ugly Cakes! I won't go anywhere else for my celebration treats."
"1","This particular Hilton is really not worth it. Here's why:\n\nIt's a weekend and the check-in lines are understandably long. But what was not bearable was how slowly the lines were moving. Only 2 attendants at the desk was just unacceptable on a busy holiday weekend and during the 3 pm check-in time. Though they were apologetic about the wait..\n\nThe A/C in the 15th floor room just refused to work hard enough to overcome 80 F.\n\nPoor quality of shower heads. If I'm being made to pay for frills, I'd like to have the frills, please. And that means I'd like to regulate how water should come out. But this shower head doesn't offer you any choices. Water will just come gushing out.\n\nOnce you park in their covered lots, good luck trying to find your way to the hotel. \n\nNo coffee machine. \n\nCrappy pillows. \n\nBut the worst part of the stay was picking up a glass to drink water only to see dirt sticking on the rim. Ugh."
"1","This was the first place open serving food that was close by our hotel once we got settled in. We split an order of nachos, which were HUGE! The late night crowd was there, and they had the lights turned down and the music blaring. Not the atmosphere I expected."
"2","My girlfriend and I came in for dinner on Wednesday and had a great experience. I tried the veggie burger and my girlfriend had the ensalada salad and both were excellent. The atmosphere of the restaurant was great but the service was the reason we will return. The hostess was helpful and patient as we decided where to sit.Ryan the busser was working very hard and never stopped moving. Our server Tim was extremely helpful and made sure our food came out quick and accurately."
"2","DELIVERY!\n\nWhoa.. that is freaky fast delivery!  I just moved back to Charlotte in Piedmont Row - and I was busy unpacking boxes. I didn't have any food in the house yet - and didn't want to leave or order a pizza...  I used their iphone app to place an order and they were here in less than 20 minutes with the sandwich and chips just the way I customized it. \n\nI love when things are simple and easy. (Well.. not when it comes to people... but food delivery... yes)\n\nAlways good to know that I don't have to leave my house or even make my own sandwiches if I don't want to.. thanks Jimmy John.. whoever you are...\n\nTry the Beach Club, but add hot peppers and extra cucumbers!\nGet a kosher dill and some thinny chips.."
"2","I actually used Yelp to find Green for the first time. I can't say I've been to a quality vegetarian restaurant until Green. \n\nThe atmosphere was a little trendy for my tastes, upon first take. The exterior was as plain as any two-bit mom-and-pop joint. It was small, but a lot of people were parked in the lot, and some were dining/hanging outside. The inside? A total surprise! The mood was set by sleak decoration and dimmed lighting. The crowd was pretty hipster and hippie alike. Our waitress had short shorts and dreadlocks.\n\nThe food was amazing. The portions were so large that I couldn't finish. Even a simple side order of thyme fries got me a basket with enough fries to share. The taste was superb.\n\nI don't go to this location as often since I've found that their 7th street one is closer to me, but Green has quickly become one of my all-time favorite restaurants."
"1","'All Cakes & Pastries 1/2 Price After 3pm'. My friend and I couldn't walk past, see that poster in the window, and not go in. Apparently, according to this friend that I was with, if it's half price then it's also half the calorie content.\n\nWhile I'm not so dumb as to believe that, I still agreed that we should go and investigate what was on offer. Which, I'm afraid to say, wasn't a huge amount. You would assume that this was because they'd all been snapped up by that time in the afternoon, but looking at the remaining ones I can't really see why.\n\nThere was nothing massively wrong with the cakes, it's just that neither of us saw anything that looked appealing enough to part with our cash - 50% discount or not. Whether or not they claim to be homemade I can't remember, but they certainly didn't look it.\n\nIt didn't help matters that the place is tiny, and so the few tables that there are are crammed in so close together that the place has a really claustrophobic feel to it. And it also meant that, as all the tables were taken, the tiny caf\u00e9 was absolutely boiling hot.\n\nMaybe we just caught it on a bad day, but Caffe Lucano certainly didn't make a very good impression on me during the minute and a half that I was in there."
"1","This place is family run and in desperate need to bring up to a acceptable level of making the right boba drink ! This place need to learn how others such as lee's sandwiches, or boba tea house are doing it right. I just feel like this place is trying to do too much (boba, ice cream, donuts). At the end of the day it doesn't one thing right! Focus on ur boba drink and donut! And make a few things that are signature to your shops to stand out from your competition!"
"2","Love this bar,awesome crowd.great bartenders.ask for a shot of Sammie Juice, Taco Tuesdays, and Fish Fry on Friday's"
"2","Great mexican food!  I had Tia's enchiladas and my partner had the braised pork.  Both were delicious.  The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because the guac was just okay.  We were both incredibly pleased with our choice."
"2","A 5 star gem!\n\nI echo Jenny D's comment on the hash brown. Super crispy exterior and moist fluffy inside - it's a piece of art.  My friend and I enjoyed the generous portion of scramble egg ($7.50), and 2 layers blueberry pancake ($5.00). Everything tasted like \""mom's food.\"" Made fresh to order, and very satisfying. \n\nNo frou-frou typical Middleton gimmick. The basic decore, and the down to earth service - the perfect spot to watch regulars enjoy the hearty breakfast."
"1","They may have a lot of lamp shades, but they are THE RUDEST people I've ever met!\n\nThe lady with short hair has a crappy attitude, so does the younger guy. \n\nOh I'm sorry that i have a question!  what an inconvenience!\n\noh and did I mentioned they close at 5pm and turned the lights off on me at 4:30??!!!!\n\nSo rude! NEVER GOING BACK"
"1","They allowed a dog inside while I was eating. Waitress was rude because she didn't really give us any attention,noticed her smiling at everyone else but our party (definitely didn't tip her) took her over 5 minutes to order some OJ after everyone else got coffee. And I don't like being handed the check while in still eating (what if I wanted something else, or wait until I'm almost done or even half way not right when I get my food) took over 45 minutes for two pancakes"
"1","Beautiful \""space\"", as the gallery attendants call it.  Which you are free to take pictures of, but not the art itself.  Fair enough.\n\nThat said, this place didn't do much for me.  It's more empty space than it is art, it would seem.  There were some very cool pieces in their galleries, but I didn't feel compelled to move through the rooms in order to discover said pieces."
"1","Never again will I be going to the MGM Grand. I had a terriable experiance here.  This review is more about the hotel rooms and teh staff than the hotel as a whole. I will say that i went to their pool and it was ok. Nothing special. They have a lazy river but it is always overly crowded and sort of a meat market. The staff at the pool was nice and when there was a lighting storm they immediatley had every guest get out of the pool\n\nI went to Las Vegas for my bachelorette party. We decided to stay at the MGM Grand because the cost for the hotel rooms were pretty decent.  We checked in on a Thursday. When we went to the front desk to check in, we immeditatley received horrbible customer service. The gentleman at the front desk was very unwelcoming. We asked if he would be able to upgrade us since it was my bachelorette party. He was able to do this for an extra fee. We decided to do this since it would end up being a larger room. He let us know that our card would not be charged until check out. (which he was incorrect about. I received a call from my fiancee why there was a charge for $800 about 5 minutes after we checked in. I had to straighten that out with teh front desk the next morning) He then asked us what our plans for this evening and we told him that we would be going to Tao for dinner. He gave us a disgusted look and told us that he had never been there but heard horrible things and that our dinner choice was a bad one. We then asked if he had any suggestions and he did not respond. He handed us our room keys and that was it.... nice was to start the weekend. \n\n\n\n\nWe went up to our room and we were blown away by how HOT our room was. I ran over to air condition and saw that it was on the coldest and highest setting. We thought since it was a larger room, maybe it needed more time to cool down. The lighting in teh hollywood suite was akso very, very dim. It was extremley hard to see much of anytihng in our room. We went out that night and when we came back, it was still so hot. it was compleltley miserable. On top of that, we could not locate the light switch to turn off the main light in the bedroom.It was about 4 am but we called the front desk in hopes that someone could help us. The woman on the other line was just as bad as the gentleman at the fron desk. She must have thought we were dumb, drunk people who were being stupid. I completley understand asking someone how to turn off the light might sound like a stupid question but we seriously could not find the light switch. We also asked her if she could send someone up to help us with our air condition as it was very hot in our room. She said someone would be up shortly...Well obviously shortly can mean very different times to different epople. A Half hour later we were still waiting for someone to come up to our room. We called about 5 more times and each time the lady would either tell us what we wanted to hear, hang up the phone or just transfer us to another department(i.e. house keeping, maintence or the food service...) very odd behavior for someone working in customer service. I get that they probably get alot of drunk phone calls in the middle of the night/early morning but  if you have someone working at that time, then i would suggest they be helpful to the people paying to stay at your hotel. FINALLY someone came to our room by 5am. He searched and searched but he too was not able to turn off the light in the main room. He asked us if he could just break the light. He almost did until he called someone else and was able to find teh light swtich; which was behind the armour. He said he had never seen something like that. He also had no idea how to fix the air condition. Great...\n\nAfter sweating through the night from the intense heat, we left  to talk to someone in person at teh front desk. A different gentleman  tried to help us with our air condition problem. He said someone would go up shortly and that we did not need to be in the room while he was fixing it...We decided to leave for an afternoon of shopping. When we came back the room was completley miserable! It was just so hot. We called teh front desk again and the woman suggest we move to anotehr room. Fantastic. So they moved us....right next door. The room was just as hot and miserable and the room was in worse condition: Lamps did not work, plugs were burnt out, furniture was broken and the air condition did not work. We then called the front desk to explain o ur dilemma and about 45 minutes later, anoterh maintence guy came up. He was in our room for about an hour and finally fixed the air condition. \n\n\nI have never had such a bad experiance at a hotel. I have never felt so un-welcome. I will NEVER go back to the MGM Grand."
"1","I took my kids to the Golden Nugget because I thought the shark tank in the middle of the pool would be cool. That was the only thing cool about it and even didn't make up for the rest of it. They do not have enough room at the pool to accommodate the size of the hotel. They are trying to keep up with the strip hotels by drawing people with there cool pool but it isn't working.  You can't enjoy a pool if you don't have a place to sit or to even stash your stuff. I swore I would never take the kids to Las Vegas but they are much older now and the Golden Nugget was off the strip plus the shark tank indicated to me that kids would be more welcome there then say, the MGM. So here I go with my big review so bare with me, I have a lot to say that will hopefully help you.\n\nFirst of all I paid for priority check-in. They told me that that would guarantee our rooms were connected and that we could check-in earlier. We arrived at 11:00am and I knew there wasn't anyway that rooms would be ready but they told me to check back in an hour.  We left our bags at the counter and went exploring. I came back at noon and still no room, still no problem because I knew check in time was at 4:00pm and even though we had priority check-in I certainly didn't expect rooms to be ready. They took my number and said they would call by 2:30pm. Fine, but I did think that wasn't exactly 'early' check-in.  They knew we were arriving at 11:00am and told me over the phone that we would have pre-assigned rooms.  Still no call at 2:30pm so I went back to the desk and once again, still no room. Again they told me they would call by 3:00pm. Still no call at 3:00pm.  Now I have four tired kids and an annoyed husband and I was pissed. I went back to the front desk for a FIFTH time and they said still no room. I asked them why I had paid for priority check-in if we actually didn't get to check-in early and we didn't have pre-assigned rooms. The front desk person went and got the manager and she came out and looked on the computer and told me that we did have pre-assigned rooms but they had granted the guests in one of the rooms A LATE CHECK OUT!  I am not a person to yell but I friggin' lost it.  Why the hell would you grant a late check out to guests in a room that was supposed to be pre-assigned for early check in?!  They scrambled and found connecting rooms with one of the rooms cleaned so we could take our stuff up....and they refunded my priority check in fees.\n\nSecond, our rooms keys worked intermittently.  We had to go to the front desk several times for new card keys.  You need your card key to get into the pool. One morning the five of us went down to the pool early (to try to get a couple chairs) but my oldest son wanted to come down later. When he got to the pool his card key didn't work. A line started building behind him and when the 'security' woman ran the card she said very loudly 'nope!' and then ran it again and said 'nope!' a couple more times. He was horribly embarrassed. He told her his parents were already at the pool and could he just please go find them and bring them back and she told him absolutely not and then yelled 'next!' so she could continue to check in other guests. He went back up to our room and sat in the hall. He couldn't call us because since he was going to the pool he hadn't brought his phone with him . Luckily my husband realized it had been about 45 mins since we had come down to the pool so he went to look for Jack and that's when he found him sitting in the hall. My husband was furious but by the time we got back down to the pool the woman was gone and there was a new dude checking people in. I got the chick's name, Mary Ellen, and wrote a letter to the Golden Nugget but never heard back.\n\nThe cost of the rooms was fairly reasonable but if you want to go to the strip a couple times then you need to add in the cost of transportation back and forth which isn't cheap.  The Luxor was pretty close to the same room rate it's a lot closer to the action.  Fremont is cool but not 5-days-in-a-row cool."
"1","The family and I had the worst experience ever. I was there on 3/26/2014. The rooms are not as clean, and customer service is rude. The valet parking sucks they have you waiting for 1/2 an hour. The food was horrible. NEVER EVER GOING BACK! The only reason I reserved this hotel was for my kids to go on the rides. Also, because my friend told me it was good for the price! Yah rite!"
"2","Clean, well run, pool was fun!"
"1","I am a licensed Cosmetologist and I came here tonight to buy a blow dryer. This was a bad decision! I bought the Ceramix Xtreme Babyliss Pro blow dryer. I just got home and I opened the box to check out my cool new blow dryer and it's definitely not new! It's all scratched up with I don't know what all over it and there's paint missing on the blue button. Whatever the yucky stuff is, is also all over the cord. TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED. I am definitely going back tomorrow to hopefully get my money back. I uploaded pictures of the blow dryer."
"2","Very clean place. Helpful staff. Wait time was a little long.\n\nShowed up here on a Saturday afternoon."
"2","Always fast service. They do an excellent job getting me back on the road after a flat. Even have free water while you wait.\n\nI always get my car back in the time promised."
"2","I'm here at Stacy's right now and I was loving it so much I had to stop in the middle of my yelp to enjoy it. This is authentic BBQ and very worth the wait. You need cash so make sure you stop at the ATM before you go. The two of us shared a pound of rib tips and a side of sweet potato fries while I personally enjoyed a cup of tangy coleslaw and sweet, I mean sweet lemonade. The ribs were easy to pull off the bone and had extra crispy pieces I liked a lot. The BBQ sauce was amazing and had a smokey flavor so the name really says it all. The fries were sprinkled with cinnamon sugar and really could have been the dessert. For a good price we had a great meal right in the heart of central Phoenix. I can't wait to take someone else there."
"1","I've been to this office a good amount of times.  Each time the receptionists give of a vibe of entitlement and it is very uncomfortable.  Dr. Weinberg herself is very nice, but I doubt her ability. Every procedure she has done to my teeth has backfired. The third and last issue I have is that i always paid cash at the end of my visits and somehow I have received an invoice for $55. I called and of course the receptionist was sassy and rude so I gave up. Will never go back or refer anyone else"
"1","How disappointed am I?  Let me count the ways...  (Please note, there are a couple of good points towards the end)\n\n\nMy wife had never tried homemade pasta so I decided to take her to this place.  I had high hopes despite it not having 5 stars on yelp.  The experience went down hill from the get-go.  \n\nGeneral:\nFirst off, seating at the Cheesecake Factory is more romantic.  Secondly, there were lipstick marks on my glass at the table.  Noticed it when they started pouring the sparkling water...and when they got a new bottle, they actually tried to charge us for it.   Yes, please let me pay for something I didn't consume!  I really hope it was an honest mistake but my feeling is it wasn't.\nOther than that, service seemed decent, but far from 5 star.\n\nDrinks:\nWine list is mostly aimed at the top 1% of the wealthy.  It fits into the restaurant like a giraffe at a polar bears only convention.  We brought our own wine thankfully...but with the 35 dollar corkage fee, the bottle wasn't the only thing getting screwed.\nTheir signature cocktail is worth avoiding.\n\nFood:\nGot the bruschetta and frittura.  Bruschetta is basically cheap hot house tomatoes with some garlic and basil loosely placed toast.  Frittura is ok, but a little too greasy.  Marinara sauce is yummy though.\n\nArugula salad.  Save your 17 dollars.  It's nothing special at all.  For 17 dollars, you could make 10 of these salad at home easily.  If you go to a classy restaurant, I would expect some creativity rather than just bowl of leaves and a couple of cherry tomatoes.\n\nMain courses - waiter suggested the lobster ravioli, it was unimainative and the fishy taste was dominant.  The pasta did not taste homemade as the waiter had said, wish I had instead taken the fusilli with lamb meatballs.  We also got the pico toscani which, funny enough being the least expensive pasta, was absolutely delicious!  Its a handrolled spaghetti of sorts.  Veal, beef and pork meat ragu, very very tasty.\n\nSide dishes - if you like salt, get the mushrooms,  they're ok but you will get a lethal dose of sodium. \n\nOverall we dropped a small fortune and we did not get what we paid for.  A note to the restaurant, consider adding a nice homemade lasagna to your menu, your meat sauce is amazing and would be be great in a lasagna."
"2","Great spot.  Great Italian food.  It's always crowded (except in the heat of summer) worth the wait and always good.   The eggplant Parmesan with a mushroom sauce is exquisite.  Everything we have tried on the menu is great.  It's a highlight to a trip to the Phoenix area."
"2","We went to Hanaya Garden today for lunch.  You walk in (past the jewelry, sword, and lucky bamboo sale displays?), order at the counter, and then pick up your entrees once their done.  \n\nWe tried the teriyaki chicken and hibachi shrimp.  Both were made to order, flavorful, came with rice and veggies, and included a side of shrimp sauce for dipping.  Although the entrees were $5.95 and $7.95 respectively, their drinks were cheap ($1.25 with refills) and you don't have to leave a tip because it's self-serve once you order and pick-up your meal.  \n\nWe sat by the makeshift waterfall (I guess that's where the \""garden\"" comes in), watched a little of the news on their big screen TV, and wondered whether anyone ever bought any jewelry, swords, or lucky bamboo.  You wouldn't know that it's a retail shop, too, until you walk in; there's nothing outside advertising it.  \n\nSure, it's not high-class Japanese food, but it was fresh made and was enjoyable for a quick lunch."
"1","Horrible attitude of the manger.. we had a reservation and they made us wait from 7 PM and we did not get the food until 9 20 PM and we just had to walk up and leave. The manager was not even sorry and did not seem to care at all. Avoid this place..\n\nI never review however this place is so horribly managed with their tablets and smartphone apps that I went ahead and made an account on yelp just to write this review."
"1","Love the yogurt, LOATHE the staff. Rude, disinterested, and condescending. Last time we were there I used the experience to educate my son about customer service and why it's important. Expecting a high school (college?) kid to smile, greet the customer and be pleasant as they're ringing up my fro-yo really isn't a lot to ask. And I blame the management because they tolerate the rudeness. Normally I wouldn't patronize a place with lousy customer service, but I keep coming back ONLY because it's the only frozen yogurt place in my neighborhood."
"2","My husband and I used the Dry Cleaning Station a few times when we lived in that area. \n\nGreat service.\n\nThe owner once did a special job for us. My daughter needed a prom-style dress cleaned for a charity event. We got it from the thrift store because she only needed to wear it once. \n\nHe went above and beyond to get the dress back to us in time and it looked fantastic, like brand new."
"1","We had mold in our bathroom. Asked them to clean never did.  No ac. But fan in ceiling.   Even numbered rooms have view of building next door see pics."
"2","I love baby stacks just because of their red velvet pancakes. Hahaha I only go their just for that but overall experience was great! It's always pack of people! I would definitely wait and stay in line just cause of the red velvet pancakes hahaha"
"1","Came here yesterday 7/6/12 to shop for a new car. We pulled into the parking lot around 6:30 and got out of the car,  not one salesperson approached us. It was nice at first, gave us time to walk around and check out the cars...  but by the time we had circled the lot twice and walked through the showroom not ONE salesperson even acknowledged us. Not even a simple hello, or may i help you.  Most likely they judged us for being younger and the car we pulled up in was nothing fancy, so they probably figured we were just looking and didn't have money.  Well Honda West, maybe you should really re-think how your business operates and don't judge a book by it's cover. We had CASH in hand to purchase a vehicle and because of the awful, rude experience we had here on our first trip, we will NEVER purchase a vehicle from this place!"
"2","This place is sooooo hip and sooooo cool. I love the decor and the vibe. I didn't think this ultra chic vibe existed in Scottsdale, but I am glad I found it. Good looking people and fun atmosphere make this an easy 5 stars!"
"1","Before evening get to review the food:\n\nOne cashier , 10 people in line. You get the picture."
"1","I do not recommend. Let's just say my experiences were not good. My animals have received much much much better care elsewhere. They were diagnosed with conditions at other vet and treated aggressively which was never done at paw creek. Dr CArnevale is rude to staff and total bond euthanized several healthy animals that lived there due to taking up space and using resources. Do not recommend AT ALL."
"1","Awesome location, average coffee, poor ambiance.   \n\nWhile I've never been a huge fan of the original Fair Trade, I was glad to see that at least a locally owned shop was opening up in the Civic Space, but after my first two visits I'm underwhelmed.  Same average coffee and food as the original (although I do give high marks to their Italian Sodas), but ZERO ambiance.  Sorry but patio furniture (uncomfortable at that), does not belong inside a coffee shop.   Hopefully they are waiting for real furniture to arrive, and will migrate the patio furniture outside where it belongs.  \n\nAnother downside is the fact that the don't seem well set up for studying and co-working. While I'm not a huge fan of computers in coffee shops, they are now ubiquitous and should be well accommodated (especially in a place that will be frequented by university students). As it is, several of the outlets are near the ceiling (sorry but Shaq is no longer in town). Moreover, they don't seem to have their own wifi, but are relying on ASU's connections.\n\nI'll chalk this initial impression up to opening week chaos, and hope that in a few weeks they'll have finished decorating and added some art to warm the place up as well as couches, easy chairs and loungers and some decent bistro tables."
"1","A friend recommended this place to me so I took my family there for dinner.  The place was clean and has a decent atmosphere.  My friend recommended the wings.  They were ok at best, and came with an extra charge for 4 carrot sticks and 1.5oz of ranch.  We ordered the Italian hoagie, a philly cheesesteak, a salad, and a pizza.  The Italian hoagie was described as \""salami, ham, & pepperoni, with sauteed onions, tomato, & lettuce with provolone cheese.  The salami they use is nasty!  I think they buy the cheepest cotto salami they can.  There was plenty of the bad salami on there, but very little ham & pepperoni.  The sandwich was greasy, & tasted like cheap meat.  Why not use genoa or hard salami, & make 30 cents less on the sandwich, but sell 5 times more of them?  The philly sandwich was a 7 outta 10, not bad.  The small house salad was good, but room temp.  We added bacon to it bringing it up to $6 for a small salad with store bought ranch.  The pizza we ordered was thin crust.  The crust had potential to be great, but was under cooked.  (I've worked at pizza joints for 25 years). The pizza came out with missing toppings.  I left it alone and waited 10 mins for the the server to check on us.  I pointed out the mistake & she told me that they're computer system made it hard for them to ring in pizzas correctly.  She offered to take the pizza back, but I just said \""bring me the missing toppings & I will add it to the pie.  After 15 mins later, there was no toppings brought to the table.  I flagged her down and asked about the toppings.  She said they would be right out.  Half of the pizza was missing meatballs & italian sausage.  She brought me a bowl of smashed up cold meatballs and dumped it on the pie.  I inquired about the Italian sausage.  She said it was smashed up with the meatballs.  It was not there.  I gave up on this place at this point.  It took 30 mins to get our tab.  I got charged for 7 toppings on a pizza that only had 3.5 toppings on.  The waitress did correct this.  I ate a slice of cold pizza with the wrong toppings on it for dinner & left angry.  I will never go back here again, nor will I recommend it to anyone."
"2","Its my wifes favorite place and i think its pretty good to. This is a new location in queen creek its great. Its great that there is finally a decent restaurant in Queen Creek. So far the two times my family and I have been here we get a seat right away but I will keep that secret to myself."
"2","I have been here so many times..I have to Yelp about it. First..I would give it 5 stars but the service is SLOW!! I have seen the servers break down/fight and generally act depressed.\nBut I go there for the cheap steak dinner & killer root beer!\nI have never had a bad reaction to the food & its always tasty. They even have a great brownie sundae if you like that sort of thing.\nSometimes the wait is long..but sit down @ a slot machine & order a drink..they will call your # when its time. We have scored many a free meal here playing & winning at video poker!\nSo yeah..its a bit of a dive but they feed ya good!\nAnd the BBQ place is top notch as well. Pizza place is not so good..a bit oily and very thin...not my kind of pizza. Im from Detroit and we like it thick like the Sunday paper!"
"1","* To be fair, I didn't actually stay to sample the food. \n\nI can only think of a handful of times I have actually walked out of a restaurant in which I intended to eat at. Unfortunately, this was one of them. This is why:\n\nMy fiance and I bought a deal over a year ago on restaurants.com to try out this place. We were actually really excited to give Columbian food a try, but for whatever reason, hadn't gotten around to using our coupon. We finally decided to just make a plan, and go for it. We looked over the menu and were really looking forward to coming here. We were expecting a little hole in the wall, with simple but tasty food. \n\nAnd maybe that is what we would have gotten on a different day. Unfortunately, the day we went, two major red flags were present. \n\n1. When we walked in, a handful of people were sitting in the \""front\"" room, which is basically a convenience store front with a few tables. We weren't offered a seat in this room. Rather the hostess walked us to the larger back room- where the lights were turned off. She told us they were off because they were trying to cool the restaurant down- there is no air conditioning in the building. \n\nWe arrived at 6:00 pm on a Wednesday. It didn't seem as though they were expecting customers. \n\n2. The second we walked in, my fiance and I both instantly noticed that the entire building wreaked of sewage. The smell could not be ignored. Sorry, but if the place I'm going to eat at smells like waste, I don't have confidence in your sanitary practices. \n\nI've never been in a restaurant that smelled, and we immediately left. The health department might want to drop in for an inspection."

"1","HORRIBLE customer service! I called to make an appointment and was told by the manager (Cherice) at the first number I called that they would honor my groupon for 2 different people (my husband and myself) to get massages, instead of buying another groupon. She couldn't fit me in though, so I was told to call another location. The other location didn't have any availability either, but she told me their third location would definitely. I called them (702-570-6587) and told her what the manager had told me about honoring the groupon. She told me she would call and check. She called back and told me the manager NEVER said that, and that they wouldn't honor my groupon. I called the manager back, and she verified what she had told me, and told me that she hadn't spoken with anyone about it. I called Lauren back, and she verified that Cherice is the one she spoke to. \n\nI WILL not ever use this salon. They call customers liars and can't get their story straight. Horrible customer service.\n\nEDIT 9/6/13 - the manager did respond to my review, and has apologized, but I still stand behind my review. Lauren may not have use the word 'liar', but she did insinuate that I was lying, and flat out lied to me twice."

"2","Great service, really great wine, good steak....what's not to like? I highly recommend the bleu cheese steak (also the bleu cheese martini). Always love coming here."
"2","Let's get to the punchline and I'll give you the story in a moment.  This guy is a genius,  he saved my computer,  worked a miracle,  and saved my holiday.\n\nI'm from out of town on a deadline.  I call Wayne at 7pm and say I need my computer fixed can you take a look?  I drive over to his  home/office and tell my sob story of having a 12 noon deadline tomorrow.  He tells me that he can't make any promises but he will try.  Over the course of the next two hours he completely reconfigures my mother board and saves me weeks (everyone said they'd have to ship it out to the manufacturer).  I can't believe he fixed the computer and he didn't even have his full ensemble of tools.  Also the price was more than reasonable given the situation.  \n\nI can't recommend him highly enough.  A miracle worker!"
"2","This is the kind of over the top dining that I like to treat myself to once in a while. Gorgeous white tablecloth service, servers in white sportscoats, beautiful bar. I wish I could have spent 3 hours drinking my way through the meal and probably will allow myself that much time next visit. \n\nI had the 12oz bone in filet, it was excellent. Our table ordered the gnocchi & crab as a side dish. Delicious even for $26.  \n\nIt's a tiny bit awkward that it's in the middle of a massive shopping mall, for this kind of evening I wish I could just put on a nice dress and heels, take a cab and have a doorman open the restaurant door for me instead of trekking through a gi-normous mall up and down escalators to get there. However they make up for it with a cool bar and outstanding service."
"1","I went for breakfast with my gf and we were quite disappointed. We ordered an omelet and it was cold. The potatoes that came with the omlet were also cold.  The coffee was relatively hot. It wasn't worth the $30 that's for sure. I could have made a better breakfast myself in 10 minutes."
"2","This location feels like the perfect spot for a TJs.  It just fits the area, we have been to the one at Arrowhead and it feels a little out of place up there.  But at Camelback and 20th its just the right fit.  I always like to buy one new thing when doing a large grocery shop and am always pleased!  \nHere are a few of our Favs: \nPeanut Butter Cream Cheese\nFresh Motz Cheese Balls \nChocolate Jo Jos\nGarlic Herb Pizza Dough\n\nThese are just to name a few.  Trader Joes knows how to do a unique, fun, healthy market."
"1","Went to Pho Nam Noodle House with The Wife for Mother-To-Be's Day. The service was good and the food came out REALLY quickly, but, unfortunately, the food was severely lacking in flavor.\n\nThe Vietnamese Spring Rolls (#2) were good, but the sauce's flavor was really weak and what little flavor the sauce did have was overpowered by the spring rolls themselves. If you know me, you know that this is a problem since I LOVE sauce.\n\nThe Wife had the Pho with Beef (well-done flank) (#9), which she enjoyed; however, I tried it and was not impressed. The beef was flavorless, so the only flavor in the dish came from the lemongrass broth, which I found boring and \""flat.\""\n\nI ordered the Beef Vermicelli Noodles (#25) which comes with stir fried lemon grass beef topped with peanuts and vegetables. When the dish was placed on the table, I was disappointed to discover that there was almost no beef in it. Seriously, there were maybe eight SMALL strips of beef and that was it. Needless to say, I didn't find the meal satisfying ... My dish also came with a small bowl of sauce on the side, which was lucky because the dish itself had literally NO sauce on it. NONE. After dumping the entire bowl of sauce onto my meal, I was again disappointed to discover that it was totally flavorless. Even The Wife, who enjoys low-flavor foods, was surprised at how absolutely flavorless my meal was. I ended up having to douse the entire dish in hoisin sauce, which the restaurant luckily has on the table, to enjoy it.\n\nI will not return to Pho Nam Noodle House."
"1","My friend and I both used a GroupOn special today that included a blowout, deep conditioning treatment, and 5 minute scalp massage. \nTo start off, the receptionist and stylists both seemed beyond put off that we had walked in the door...even though we had made appointments. As I sat down, my stylist said \""you have a lot of hair. Great.\"" And rolled her eyes. Not \""Great!\"" as in what nice hair you have, but \""I can't believe I have to deal with this.\"" \nThings warmed up during the wash, and the scalp massage was great- although nowhere near 5 minutes long. \nShe did a good job styling my hair, but not the best I've seen. Best part was that my hair is still curly a few hours later, more than I can say for the DryBar. \nOverall a good turnout on both of our styles, but the experience wasn't great. I probably won't return. Had I paid the full $55 the service was worth, as opposed to the $22 pride I got with Groupon, I would have been more upset."
"2","Been to his karaoke spot 3 times and every single time I've had so much fun!!! All of their food is good, especially the hot wings and the French fries! They have a great selection of music. However, they don't have any salt and pepper music which I was kind of bummed about. Other than that the place is great! The employees are always so nice. The last I came with a bunch of friends, we ended up dancing in the lobby for an hour because the music was so good. Definitely a great place to come to with a group of friends to have some good ol fashioned fun!! Highly recommended. Side note: there's no age limit until 10pm, after that it's 18+."
"2","I wanted to end 2012 on a high note. In reality I ended 2012 on a high summit.\n\n  My original plan was to spend my ultimate hike of 2012 climbing up Frenchman Mountain. As the weekdays turned into the weekend, I thought that I could use just a bit more warming up before I returned to Frenchman Mountain. Lone Mountain would be my ultimate hike of 2012.\n\n   I have always been enchanted by Lone Mountain's setting on the Valley floor right off the 215.  This is one exit where nature dominates. Whenever I drove on the 215, I had been curious about this mountain that stands to the east of it between Lone Mountain and Alexander Roads. After doing my research, I was confident that  A) this would be an awesome hike and B) Lone Mountain deserved to be a hiking listing on Yelp.\n\n  The best way to describe Lone Mountain is visualizing an oval with the long sides being vertical. The oval would be surrounded by Alexander Road to the south, Jensen Street to the east, the 215 to the north, and Vegas Vista Street to the west. Between the roadways is a trail circumventing it with some homes sprinkled in. The top left of the oval (northwest) would be the Vegas Vista trailhead parking lot with the hiking trail to the top of the summit. On the right side of the oval is Lone Mountain Park.\n\n  I am a worrier when it comes to leaving my car in isolation. Especially when I am climbing up a mountain. Regardless that the closest parking facility is where Vegas Vista dead ends, I added extra miles to the hike parking at Lone Mountain Park. This gave me the perception that the people walking their dogs, spending time with their kids at the playground, and picnicking (maybe I should write a review on Lone Mountain Park) were extra eyes. The extra time that I spent walking on the perimeter trail halfway around around Lone Mountain provided me with nice pictures, an introduction to Lone Mountain, and anticipation. On the walk back to my car, I hiked the other segment of the perimeter trail. I enjoyed  looking up at where I just hiked, and seeing more of Lone Mountain. Prior to walking on the perimeter trail, I was unaware that Lone Mountain has trails leading to caves. I would not notice this if I just got back in my car. Sundown is the best time for an extended walk around Lone Mountain on the perimeter trail.\n\n  The best way to describe the hike on Lone Mountain is that it is two hikes. Hike one took me on an east ascent to the lower summit. There is a bench (with graffiti) to sit back end enjoy the view. On the right will be hike two, which is up the south accent to the higher summit. If I was really up to it, I could of walked higher and reached a third summit.\n\n   Lone Mountain is no joke. I am so happy that I brought along a hiking pole. It literally saved me from some falls. My hiking philosophy is that three legs are better than a broken leg. Throughout the trail, there are steep inclines with loose rock and gravel. In some spots, the rocky steps require a hiking pole. For the record, there are spots on Lone Mountain without a barrier to prevent a fall. If the weather was warm, I certainly would of brought along water. Vegetation is relatively nonexistent on Lone Mountain. On warm days dehydration is another concern.\n\n   The view from the top of Lone Mountain is so worth the hike. I came to the realization that the views from the shorter summit is just as good as the higher summit. The only flaw was that I could not see the south valley. Most likely if I kept climbing to the highest point, I would look down on all of the valley below. What I saw was breathtaking views of the Strip, downtown, and the north valley.\n\n   I give Lone Mountain 4 stars. Thanks to Lone Mountain, I ended 2012 on a high note."
"2","Very good and has a really good variety of meats you can try."
"2","Phat Burrito's burritos are just that: Phat. And, depending on how you order them, they're Fat too. And really, there's no reason to order anything else. \n\nChoose from BBQ Chicken, Steak, Chicken, Fish and Grilled Veggies (the girlfriend's pick every time). Surprisingly, the fish is excellent--and at a really good value. It's like a blackened Tilapia and comes with a pineapple-y salsa. Extremely tasty. Everything else is good as well--and you can add beans (black, spicy red or refried) for no additional cost. Go with the spicy red; you won't be disappointed. The guacamole isnt anything special, but it's fresh and tasty, so throw that on your burrito as well. \n\nGrab a Modelo as your cerveza and you're all set to enjoy the funky decor of the spare inside. Outside seating is perfect for a warm evening, and there's often a mellow hipster crowd out there enjoying itself. \n\nLife is Phat."
"1","Well... Decor is neat, food is decent, the price is right and I guess ignorant service is part of the deal.\n\nService is not terrible, but forgotten stuff, cluelessness of our waiter, her fake, robotic smiles and overall slowness and mix-ups were very annoying.\n\nThe real question: can we expect better service at this price? And my answer is: probably not, but...\n\nMy advice to the boss: simplify you menu, educate your staff, stop pretending that you're higher-end than you really are and everything will feel much smoother for us, your customers."
"2","Ate at La Hacienda on Thanksgiving Eve. Truly exceptional food and service. Expensive but worth it.    \n\nWe made a meal for four from appetizers. All were exquisite. Guacamole sampler was inventive. Empanadas were wonderful. Best of all the sweet corn tamales. Chocolate flan was sinful."
"2","We just happened to wander our way and found this place, and boy, am I glad we did. \n\nWe thought it was funny that we're ordering at the NUMBER ONE BOBA PLACE, but it lived up to its name, forelios. \n\nI got the papaya milktea thingy majingy (forgot the exact name), but it was SOOOO GOOD. Best boba I've had in a long time! All my friends loved the drinks that they ordered too. It was so fresh and they used real fruits! Loved it.\n\nI can't wait to come back to Vegas and get some good boba milktea. And to party of course haha."
"1","We ordered lunch from Indian Curry Bowl yesterday, and I can't say enough about how HORRIBLE it was.  Not just the food, but the entire experience.  The food was very overpriced.  For 2 entrees, 1 side, and 2 orders of Samosas, the total came to $72!!  I was shocked, and looked over the receipt.  They were charging me $10 for chutney??!?  I eat Indian food from many different establishments on a regular bases, and the chutney is ALWAYS complimentary.  It's like charging for ketchup.  \n\nWhile I was waiting for my order, I was watching the elderly woman prepare the food using...... a microwave.  Really?  No burners or stoves going, just a couple of microwaves.  The food was not good at all.  The Samosas were soggy and undercooked, the Chicken Tikka Masala and Saag Paneer were runny and looked like they literally had been mixed with water.  \n\nSo basically, I paid over $70 for food that was microwaved (seriously, I'm still appalled by that one) and terrible.  Never again!!!!"
"2","I had a good experience with the Conscious Carnivore. We ordered a 6lb beef tenderloin for our annual Christmas party. I called about a week beforehand, asked for the price of the beef, and the young woman on the phone couldn't answer me for sure. She offered to call back with pricing, and I said that was fine. She did return my call and tell me the price, which was satisfactory to me. So I ordered the tenderloin and specifically told her that I wanted it to be a whole 6lb tenderloin (not two three-pound tenderloins, for example).\n\nUnfortunately she either didn't listen, didn't write it down, or it got lost in translation somewhere. When my husband went to pick it up, it was two three-pound tenderloins. I was pretty unhappy because I had specifically asked for a whole one and the woman on the phone said that that would not be a problem. \n\nThe quality of the meat was excellent, and the butchers go out of their way to make sure the meat is tied correctly for even cooking. That is a HUGE plus in my book. In addition, they make sure all the silver skin is off the beef, which is, again, a huge plus. Everyone at my party complimented the meat and asked where we got it, and it was tender and delicious even though I overcooked it slightly. I would definitely go back to the Conscious Carnivore again, but I don't know if I'd order a big cut of meat again because I'm not willing to chance that the order gets messed up."
"2","Listen,  I cant put into words of wisdom what I experienced here, all I can say is GO!  Stop reading all the reviews and just experience the place for yourself. The 5 stars is from a guy who just loves to eat great food.... I've traveled all over and have eaten at fancy restaurants without having 1/2 the experience I had at Barrymore's. The strip is loaded with big name chefs turn restaurateurs and some have succeeded and some have failed. The key to surviving in sin city is not your celebrity name, who you know and blah, blah, blah...\n\n\n\nTaste, Quality, depth, creativity, comfort and off the hook-great service-BAM!\n\n\nThe Barrymore has it all-\n\n\n\nI'm done..........exit, stage left!\n\nJUST GO!"
"1","I'd visited the Sugar Factory a few years ago once before and had a similar \""meh\"" experience. I thought that things might have improved, but alas, no such luck.  It appears that they've scaled back their menu, at least in terms of entrees. They still have the large selection of specialty drinks and desserts, however. Entrees ranged from $15-$30, which seemed pretty high for this type of restaurant. \n\nWe visited with a group of 5 friends on a Sunday afternoon.  It was extremely busy, so there was a bit of a wait. I liked the new system of giving the hostess your cell phone number so they could text you when your table was ready (although I hope that's not a marketing ploy and they don't text all the time with \""specials.\"").  Our table was right by the bar, which wasn't my preference, but given how busy it was, I didn't mind terribly.\n\nOur server took quite awhile to come to take our drink orders. I was the only one to order a non-alcoholic drink, and my beverage arrived last- in fact, I had to remind her of it.  She wasn't particularly friendly; she just seemed stressed.  The food similarly took quite awhile. I ordered the turkey club sandwich, which given the description, I expected to be served warm. While the bread was somewhat warm, imagine my surprise when I bit into it and was greeted with cold meat and fixings.  The fries were just fine. \n\nThe server did not ask if we preferred the check to be split, so of course there was some confusion when it arrived. She was able to split it for us, but seemed really put off by it.  There also was an 18% gratuity already added (I'm assuming that is for groups of 6 or larger). Luckily I saw it before I paid, so I didn't double tip.  However, paying $30 for a lackluster sandwich, fries, and a Pepsi, along with a server who would have rather been doing something else, is not the way I prefer to spend a Sunday."
"2","Ate there for the first time in a while. Many people I know, like the place, others just don't. We've never had bad food there. During busy season, expect to spend 90 minutes from start to finish. This is not a service problem, but a kitchen issue. The orange roughy was not good, it was SUPERB, and the chicken stir fry, very good. Food was served warm, and the service provided by Jeff was exemplary. There has been an influx of younger servers who are extremely effective, accomodating, and polite. You get a big bang for your buck. Based on our experiences, it would seem that the negativity is unwarranted."
"1","I wish I could give a minus 5.  This was the most unorganized set up I've seen in a while.  We had to stop here on the way back from Mexico.  It took so long to get through Immigration and Customs, I swear the employees were on some kind of slow motion drugs.  We were about to miss our flight- in fact someone had to call the gate to ask them to wait for us.  When we saw the mile long line for security, we panicked.  I thought if I asked the security man very nicely if we could go to the head, since the plane was waiting, perhaps he would help us.  WRONG!!!  He was the rudest, most ignorant employee I encountered in the entire airport.   We ran our asses off and got to our gate just as they were closing the doors.  Luckily they let us board.  From now on it's non-stop for us!!!"
"1","0 stars! Show turned off 5 min in! Worst Vegas show experience ever! So disappointed. May never book another Vegas show again. Thanks for nothing Mandalay Bay"
"1","The owner, Mrs. Kim is not a tailor, do not give her your clothes to work on them. She doesn't know how to take measurements, and she opened a hole in my shirt with her scissors. This is the worse experience of customer service I have had, she refused to reimburse me for the tailoring job. \nTheir prices are low but sometimes they don't do a good cleaning job on white shirts. I don't think they use adequate detergent."
"1","Came in almost 20 mins ago after getting seated... the waitress never acknowledged us... did not greet us or ask us to wait a moment.  We just sat there for over 20 mins... no water nothing just to see people just come in after us and get their order taken as soon as they sat down. A lady who seem to be in regular clothes possibly a supervisor finally came over.  So I complained and told her what happened with the people who got their order taken I told her I'm just going to order everything now.  Today is ihop's sweet 56... which I just turned sour for.  56 cent pancakes...  it was probably worth it just to run over to dennys.  There is no excuse no matter how busy... and slow your service is and understaffed for the event that you cannot greet everyone when they sit and let them know u will be with them shortly... its just common courtesy.  A guy behind us was upset and got out loud about it.  Some people just left their money at the pay counter because nobody was there to ring them up.  What an easy opportunity to get robbed.  Ihop get your sh*t together and all your staffed properly trained because your horribble service is insulting and degrating to customers like me who go and eat out a lot."
"2","The food here was great! We had the red curry with beef and yellow curry with chicken. Both were delicious and the perfect amount of heat thanks to the recommendation of the owner. The restaurant sits in an almost empty shopping center and there isn't signage you can see from the street. We have lived in the area 3 years and had no idea it was ever here. Thanks to Yelp we found this great place. The owner and family were there including their friendly young son. He was entertaining and trying to play with our son, it was sweet. We will be back."
"2","Brought my parents here for their 37th Wedding Anniversary and it was such a great experience! The food and service is truly impeccable and probably one of the best Mexican restaurants I have been to a long time. We ordered several of their Taco's a la carte and all were fantastic. Amazing spicy Serrano margaritas to accompany the food. I can't wait to visit my parents and go back to place!"
"2","My wife and I had the family dinner. The sizzling rice soup alone was worth the trip. The PooPoo platter was just OK--nothing spectacular, but by the time our entrees arrived we were pretty full. We had Moo Goo Gai Pan and Orange Beef with Pork fried rice. All were superlative. We got a total of 5 meals out of it. Highly recommended, bring lots of hungry people and don't over-order. We will be back to explore the. menu. Really more like 4-1/2 stars."
"1","Wow, almost hate to do this but I've eaten here many times. The cook seems to have a real attitude. The wait staff are very pleasant as is the owner and his family. Today, I found crushed egg shells in my German pancake and the cooks response was: \"" there's a lot of eggs that go into them so that will happen\"". Not the reply I was expecting. This , unfortunately , was not the first time that I found something\"" other than\""in my food. The last time it was hair. I doubt I'll be returning anymore."
"1","Whatever you do , do not use the roadside assistance, they contract with a company called Agero and my husband was on the side of the road for 7 hours in 105degree heat waiting for a tow truck .Every time we called they said the trucks on the way. We have been members for over 25 years and have at least eight different products through USAA. I guess you get what you pay for, since its free, that's what you get very bad service. The day after that happened we went to AAA and got membership, I know it would only take 30 minutes or less for tow with them!!!! Hope no one else goes thru what we did."
"1","My friend and I ate here for lunch on 10/31/14. Our waitress was Norma and she was excellent! First, I recommend you really read the menu board. ONLY Monday - Thursday can you get the lunch for $7.95. Otherwise, it's nearly triple the price! \n\nBeer is cheap! $4.00. We ordered the Oyster Rockefeller and it was good. You get 6 large baked oysters for $15. Next, we ordered the Combo Pan roasted shrimp and crab. It was good and hot. However, it doesn't come close to the pan roast at Ocean Trail in Scottsdale -- which is my No. 1 favorite. You will have to do a lot better to pass Ocean Trail. But overall, it was OK. Nothing remarkable; a bit pricey for what you get. Total tab for lunch was $73.00 without tip. That was with only 1 beer and 1 wine."
"2","Jorge and his team are awesome. They were professional and did clean work. \nJorge came over and took measurements of the area that where we would want to put the gate. He showed us samples that were recognizable from around our neighborhood. We got online with his website and picked out different examples we thought we would like for our own home. He gave us a rendering and we may have gone back three or four times with different changes. He was completely open to making any alterations that we requested. He kept reminding us that this is our gate and we will be looking at it. \nExcellent work. We will use his services in the future."
"1","I had loved this place (read my earlier review). However, they have been trying too hard to the point of being pretentious. I have tried taking my colleagues to this place for a happy hour at 5pm and despite having an empty restaurant at that time, they were playing hard to fit a group of 6 people (we were flexible to split into two groups as well). Leaving that incident aside, I met up with a friend last evening at the bar area and again had a bad experience. Also, they were the first restaurant I have seen in Pittsburgh to charge me two bucks for ice to go along with my whiskey! Thanks but no thanks!"
"1","First time and last...very dissapointed w service and food not good at all...guess that we are  not coming back. Joe's Crabs is.the best."
"1","Was treated with total disrespect by a female employee when I asked if they had another color of a shoe in stock. She told me color doesn't matter but the shoe does. I know that (duh) but I still want my shoes to look good on me. Don't treat me like a second rate citizen because I care about the color.  This particular person was very snooty. I will not support a place that treats their customers like dirt."
"2","Yummy, cheap, and clean! Love the revolving bar too! My husband and I end up going here almost every date night just because we love it so much. And we've tried other sushi places, they don't compare!"
"1","Horribly run business. They took money out of my account without my permission, i spent hours on the phone and they told me they would credit my account but i wouldnt recieve all my money back. No one would help me or return my phone calls."
"1","This new BBQ shack is hidden behind Crepes Mille and Perla.  Try to find it, it's quite an adventure.  Hopefully they will move a bit more out into the open!\n\nThey offer a nice variety of BBQ meats, in taco form or plate form.  Cheap too.  I got the brisket, chicken, and fish.  Yep, SMOKED fish taco.\n\nThe brisket and chicken were both a bit dry and underseasoned, but the fish was moist, and tender, though a bit fishy.\n\nTry it out, see if you like it.  Wasn't too impressed.  Seems pretty new, maybe they'll work out some of the kinks in the meat."
"2","Drop the convenience and you got yourself an all-start liquor store. For some reason, walking in and seeing bags of chips, slim jims and shampoo does nothing for me. So, going forward, I shall call this place \""Star Liquor Store.\"" And what better name to have on Yelp, eh? Especially when the booze selection earns 5 Yelp stars. \n\nI'll un-cap (get it?) the star-worthy appeal:\n+They sell the White Chocolate Ale from a local AZ brewery (it's amazing)\n+You can pick up a single pint glass or beer mug (wine glasses too)\n+They carry Rogue and most all other major West coast breweries\n+Their wine selection is impressive and they have liquor too!\n+Their prices are competitive and cheaper than BevMo\n\nThis is fast becoming my fave spot to stop. You won't have to fight the noise or crowd of Papago to pick up a 6-pack. And the owners are super nice with excellent service.\n\nCheck out their site: http://www.starlc.com/"
"1","Though I like the pharmacist, the pharm techs at this location have the WORST customer service! Several times they did not fill my Rx within 24 hours, for different reasons. Never did they call me or my doctor and try to resolve the situation ... they just waited till I showed back up to inform me there was a problem. No apologies, not even a smile. \n\nThe pharmacist once overheard me telling the tech that I had come back three times and my Rx still hadn't been filled. He offered me a gift card and apologized for my trouble, and I was very grateful. But really, me having to return three times for an Rx I fill every month? Inexcusable. \n\nOnce I walked up to the RX counter inside the store to ask where to find an OTC medicine. I was sick, could barely function, and the tech didn't even look up from her cell phone ... she just said, \""Isle ten.\"" I said, \""I looked in isle ten and didn't see it.\"" She totally ignored me and kept texting!! I muttered, \""Thanks for nothing,\"" and stumbled away. Thankfully the same sweet pharmacist saw the interaction and dropped what he was doing to come and help me. \n\nThere's a creepy tech with a greezy skullett that is rude every time (he has screwed up my Rx twice). Now he just takes my money and shoves my Rx through the window at me. \n\nIf it wasn't for the exemplary pharmacist, and the close proximity to my house, I would never return to this location."
"1","Blended coffee drinks--too sweet\nTea--the flavor didn't taste pure (I am a tea snob).  \nPrice--ugly ($5.95+ per cup)\n\nIf the quality was better, I would be happy to pay more.  However, even with the convenience factor of being an elevator ride away, I still will refuse to go here.  Starbucks has better tea.  For better (Lavazza) coffee, go to the coffee shop Presso by taking the elevator to the Palazzo shops.  Pricey still but better quality. \n\nP.S. Upon checking in at the Palazzo the passport has a B1G1 free coupon.  Very restrictive on what you can use and I would rather pay more for better coffee!\n\nService--nice person ad the front, but the machine which charges to your room was not functioning, so that was annoying.  I also was not too happy about the restrictions placed on type of drinks...given that it's the same price, and your margin is high, why does it matter whether my choice is \""seasonal?\""  You are practically turning away business!\n\nWill not be back..."
"2","Given the paucity of good craft beer selections in Vegas, this place gets a high star rating.  Prices are reasonable for Vegas too, considering that many of these same beers would cost you the same price in a top notch beer bar that isn't in a city like Vegas.  They were open mid morning which was perfect for me to enjoy my Dogfish Head Pale Ale shortly after breakfast.  Bar is made of cracked glass fragments that is quite cool."
"2","For Vegas, the pricing is pretty decent. A little less than $20 for a very nice burger. I ordered a medium rare burger and it came out ever so slightly overdone, but still very juicy and embarrassing to eat. Everyone I dined with (5 people) was pleased with their meal. Others ordered pizza, soup, pasta and a panini. Nothing was \""the best ever\"" but it was all solidly very good, and reasonably priced for lunch. Service was great too. Polite without being condescending."
"2","We went here for the first time last night and were pretty happy with everything. Our four year old son has every allergy imaginable except for nuts and eggs so this place sounded like a good idea. The service was very slow but the waitress was pleasant. We ordered all the appetizers except for one. The Quinoa Tabouli was yummy but a very small portion for $6. The Lemon Hummus did not have much flavor but came with a nice sized plate of veggies so we were alright with it. The Air-Fried Sweet Potato Fries were really good and a big hit with my son. The Veggie Pasta was my husband's and my favorite and a very close second for my son. The Three-Bean Chili was cold, too spicy and gross. They had 2 differect kinds of iced tea and they were both good and came with free refills. I have to give this place 4 stars because all in all, we were very pleased with our meal and experience here. We will be back to try some different dishes."
"2","I went for the gelato, and I was impressed with the imaginative flavors (red velvet cake...). I had pistachio, and my friend L.C. had cookies and cream. We also sampled butterscotch chip and a few sorbets. Everything was delicious.\n\nWe didn't have any coffee, but I will definitely try it next time I'm in the neighborhood. The barista / gelato schlepper (his description) seemed to be on his game and the coffee aroma was tempting.\n\nThe other reviews mentioned the chain pizza / rumpus room / rehab center picnic area decor. Yes, it's all true. With the power supplies (for laptops) above table level, the place also looks like the ship in The Matrix.\n\nBTW, the gelato end of the business is called Monster Gelato. Monster must be the name of a cat, as one scoop is called a \""kitty\"" (or maybe \""kitten\"") and the larger portions are identified as cat sizes. The place is eccentric -- but definitely independent!"
"2","This review is really for the service and Cuban Pork Sandwich.  It was SUBLIME and makes my list of best sandwiches EVER. I'd go back in an instant."
"2","Why would anyone give a bad rating to this M & M store?\n\n4 floors of chocolatey goodness and cute memorabilia... you can't go wrong.\n\nI really enjoyed the 3rd floor where they have the counter where you can personalize your m & m's.\n\nAnd really... nothing says I love you more than personalized Happy Anniversary m & m's :-)\n\nthey package them up and as long as you store them correctly, they're good for 1 year.  Perfect!  Just in time to get next year's anniversary chocolates!"
"1","I've only visited the attic on weekend nights, so I can't speak to the atmosphere on a more mellow night, but on weekends this place is slammed.\n\nYou get 2 for the price of 1 at The Attic, because it connects to Madison's. And when both places get crowded, watch out. The Attic is just too small for the amount of people they let upstairs, along with them trying to have a dance floor. It can take quite a while to get a beer at the bar cause of the crowd. And on a busy night, don't even try getting outside. If you aren't there early, just forget about it all together.\n\nPeople really do get into it on the dancefloor, so that can be an escape from the crowdedness around it. There seems to always be a wedding party here for some reason, so expect some dressed up drunken folk dancing away.\n\nThe Attic just gets too crowded for me & isn't really anything special. Just like Madison's, I'm not sure what their differentiating factor is to set them apart from other Charlotte bars, but it doesn't appeal to me if they have one."
"2","This is a very cool, relaxed atmosphere. The wait staff, managment staff, security was top notch. The food was PHENOMENAL! The price point was fair.  You must try their raw bar too.  We went twice in four days and the second evening from 9pm -10 pm (Wednesday) they offered $0.25 beer by this time I thought that I was at a nightclub in college.  \n\nIt's overall a great place to let loose, eat good, drink good and listen to great music and receive EXCELLENT guest service....\n\nBTW, I failed to mention that their portions are large and the presentation was quite impressive."
"2","saw a show at the glass nickel as part of a super cool yelp event (i'm told there are many). i was a virgin to all three.  cherry (tomato) (sauce) popped hours later, i'm driving home in the afterglow.  \n\nif u have a chance to catch their saturday night show DO IT!  and if u have a chance to volunteer to act out a scene with them, DOUBLE DOG DARE DO IT! \ni laughed so hard and loved it so much, i'm hooked and MBI is my pimp."
"2","If you want to change the way you look at Edinburgh, take a walk along the Leith walkway.\n\nIt's an absolutely gorgeous scenic route right through the heart of Edinburgh. Unlike the film depictions and misconceptions, you'll find yourself surprised and quite taken with the beautiful area, and seeing a side of Leith that you may never have seen before.\n\nThe walkway itself is picturesque, and since it's full of friendly dog walkers whenever I take a stroll , I feel quite safe walking along it by myself. I love diving out the city for a while into a calm, tranquil wonderland of green and grey-blue. For that it can't be beat. Definitely one of the best alternative ways to see virtually undiscovered parts of the city."
"2","Rachel's Kitchen is a wonderful place for brunch and the menu has something for everyone. As a local, I enjoy this location in Henderson and all of the shopping that surrounds it. Don't forget the happy hour specials for half-priced mimosas!"
"2","Went back to Arcadia's Wildflower Bread Company today for a farewell lunch for a coworker.  I started Weight Watchers on Sunday, so I prepared by going to the Wildflower website and calculating the \""points\"" from their nutrition pages.  Thanks, Wildflower, for making that info available.  But, Holy Cats!  My friend had urged me to try their salads, which she loves.  The two salads for which I calculated \""points\"" totalled 22 and 23 points.  My daily total is 29 points.  And salad is not great as a leftover.  I ended up with the vegetarian lentil soup.  I could eat the bread with butter and my total was still only 11 points.  Plus, I tried a new soup and am now a big fan of the tasty veggie lentil.  Parking was once again a challenge, but I was on my motor scooter, which enables me to improvise parking."
"1","They close by midnight. Maybe they should update their business hours both online and posted."
"2","I was at El Chorro for a wedding rehearsal dinner so my review is based on their private dining services and not the normal dining experience.\n\nUpon driving up to the restaurant there is a professional valet that quickly and efficiently gets you out of your car and on your way to a culinary adventure.  \n\nOur wedding party had a large private room off to the left of the main restaurant.  While walking over (on a hot and humid day) I noticed several huge mobile air conditioning units to cool the customers on the patio.  I was impressed by them because it's a thoughtful gesture that I haven't seen in many places.  These weren't the cheap (worthless) models.  They were some serious industrial A.C. units and they felt great.\n\nThe area we had was pretty secluded and private (away from the regular restaurant).  It had a great patio for cocktail hour.  The service was friendly and professional.  They were quick with drinks and quick to clean up empty glasses.\n\nThe dinner itself was magnificent.  We had a party of ~ 40 people but the service and the food was that of a quaint 5 star dining experience.  The deserts were so good I feared a massive sugar buzz so I had to contain myself (see my uploaded photos).\n\nOverall, it was a 5 star experience.  If anyone is considering having a private dinner here (wedding or otherwise) I'd highly recommend it.\n\nFantastic!"
"1","I stayed here a few years ago on my 2nd trip to Vegas. We wanted something cheap and we got it. The bed had cigarette stains and holes in it. the tropical decor was so cheesy. We were not in the room very much but when you have the spins from drinking it is not fun to hear the cars in the next door parking structure. It gave me motion sickness too. I threw up in the elevator, which is tiny and all through the casino. I will not go back here, bad memories, but everyone needs one really cheesy nasty vegas stay I guess.\n\nOh Yeah I guess they are planning on tearing it down for a new casino."
"2","\""The $17,000,000 Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars Palace offers a feast that boasts more than 500 options and may well take the ongoing battle of Las Vegas buffets to a new level. Bacchanal Buffet premiered on September 11th after a complete wall-to-wall renovation from the previous Lago Buffet and will likely become a culinary mainstay like the Carnival World Buffet, which opened over two decades ago.\"" - Chris Rauschnot, The Huffington Post\n\nSo good ol' rich Caesar decided he was bored of his crapLago Buffet [finally] and decided to do something with his endless stack of pure and unadulterated cash to fix the main culinary mess in his own backyard. Although having expected much less, pumping $17 million just means that from launch and to a certain extent of time...this buffet is going to be - for lack of better words - G.R.E.A.T. But this article also mentions the Carnival World Buffet (by the way, is no longer that great...) as a parallel, which serves one main point...this place will only be good for \""so long\"". SO GET YOUR GLUTTON ARSE OVER HERE QUICK...while it is still this freaking G.R.E.A.T.\n\nService is great as the staff definitely display their enthusiasm to work at the \""best buffet\"" in Vegas (loved how the cashier reiterated that to us SEVERAL times). Need refills? It comes automatically. Need your plates to disappear? No, you don't need to chuck it under the table...they efficiently disappear on their own - even if you're a speedy little punk like me (gone and back within a minute with another full plate).\n\nSo after coming here several times for both lunch and dinner, I would recommend lunch if you don't want to break your wallet since the difference between both meals is minimal. If you have the 24-hour-Buffet pass, please note that you'll need to pay an extra $16'ish bucks per entry.\n\nSummary of my main LIKES (this is what I come here for):\n\n- EVERYTHING AT THE CARVING STATION: really tender and juicy prime rib, fall off the bone baby back ribs, luscious lamb chops, sausages and more!\n- Steamed crab legs\n- Fresh raw oysters: one of few times I would recommend RAW oysters at a buffet (additional Japanese version at dinner)\n- GIANT cocktail shrimps...holy crap, these are the 5-8/lb types!\n- Ginseng chicken soup and Chinese BBQ (especially the char siew...gives Sam Woo a run for its money - now that's something)\n- Cheese and prosciutto section (used these on my salads)\n- Bottled fruit juices (lunch only)\n- DESSERTS: non-sweetened desserts such as the cheesecake was a plus for me!\n\nCaesar made the right decision with his \""back-anal\"" (bacch-anal) investment and is definitely raking in the profits once again to Rome. \n\nI definitely RECOMMEND this Vegas buffet (for now - before it eventually ends up like Carnival World Buffet)!"
"1","The parking is not that easy here, even if you arrived early.  I think that we ended up in someone's backyard lot.  It's not that close to the freeways.  But, catching the W.Sox v. Cubs game here for Spring Training is awesome!  However, don't get me wrong, it's not even a tenth as good as catching the rivalry in Wrigley (which I've done too), but close."
"2","Craftsteak is a very pricey but excellent steakhouse.  It's a beautifully warm, elegant setting, with d\u00e9cor mainly in dark shades, wood, and leather.  There're also beautiful, colorful, lively, fun paintings of cows -- yes, cows -- on the walls over the booths.  The staff is outstanding -- friendly, patient, helpful, knowledgeable, and efficient.\n\nThe menu is surprisingly large (I rarely see a menu this size at a place categorized as \""fine dining\""), as are the portions -- you won't go hungry here without trying, especially if you have a party of four or less and go with the family style option...sooooo much excellent food!  The food has great flavor, especially the meats (of course) and, surprisingly, the bibb salad, which had a light blue-cheese dressing that brought the components together perfectly.  The drinks list is HUGE, with especially extensive wine and scotch sections.\n\nMy one issue with Craftsteak is that I felt like it was very overpriced -- even though the quality is excellent -- especially the drinks.  (I knew the bottle prices of a few of the scotches on the list and the markup on a glass seemed ridiculously high to me.)"
"1","I took my new puppy here twice because everyone at PetSmart has been very friendly and helpful so I expected great service from pet hospital inside as well. I was very disappointed with with doctor I saw here, I should never have wasted my money the second time. It is obvious that this pet hospital is more concerned about getting as much money as they can out of you than rather than giving your pet the best care.\n\nBeing a new puppy owner I had a lot of questions and trusted what the doctor was saying. He suggested giving my puppy Science Diet which I bought and it made my dog very sick. After doing some research, I checked the ingredients- all corn and fillers, horrible for my puppy. The next time we went in for shots and I told him my puppy had been having more accidents inside lately and he offered to give him a urine analysis or to put him on antibiotics without even testing him for anything. He also referred to my puppy as a boxer; I have a Boston terrier. \n\nExpensive and impersonal care, I would not recommend that anyone who wants the best care for their pet goes here."
"2","Love this place and let me tell you why, not only is it because of the food-- It's the customer service I get at this place!!! It had been a while since I have been in and I mean months, Emily remembered my name and what I order! She IS the  definition of what customer service is. Yes I understand its hard remembering names and what each person orders. But no matter what she always has a smile on her face and talks the same way to each person! She is going to go far in life no matter where or what she ends up doing! Thank you! And thank you Smashburger for making excellent choices when you hire people. \n\nNow on to the food-\nThe \""Smash Fries\"" have rosemary and olive oil on them... they are a great change from your normal everyday fries.\nThe Arizona Burger is really tasty, hot jalapenos piled high (I love this), habanero cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, purple onion, chipotle mayo, all on a chipotle bun.\n\nPlus++++ if you join their club they send amazing coupons to you!"
"2","Tried the fried egg burger. Delicious!  My wife and I are really starting to like this place. I would recommend giving it a shot!"
"1","NEEDS BETTER FOOD!!! Even Oakland upgraded... get with it Phoenix!!!"
"1","I went here one night with my friends and we heard advertisements about 2$ beers for guys and free drinks for girls with wristbands. We get there they physically hand us a flyer for all of the advertisements and still wouldn't give us the deal!!!! It was ridiculous, I literally had a flyer with the info in my hand! Then all the bar tenders were rude and also this place won't decide If it's a lame night club or a food/bar joint. Get real. First time and never again.the only thing good was Garrett sliger unfortunately he know longers works for the restuarnt"
"2","This was supposed to be my Holy Grail of food experiences. I had heard nothing but great things about \u00e9, I just had to find someone to go with that would be just as excited as I was to try it. Luckily, I found two people! We made our reservations 2 months in advance, knowing that there was 3 in our party, and they only seat 8 at a time, we thought it would be difficult since we had an odd number in our party. \n\nFinallly, the night came, I really couldn't contain my excitement for what was about to happen. We were led passed the bar area into another room. It was very quaint, dark and had a Spanish vibe to it. We were introduced to the culinary team. Cody, the sous chef was really good at explaining what dishes they were plating, and what we could expect when tasting the food. \n\nOut of the 20 tastings, a couple really stood out for me, #1 Lobster with Citrus & Jasmin, #2 Secreto Iberico Pork with Squid. My favorite dessert was the Pan con Chocolate. Two of my least favorites were the Foie Gras and the Fabes con Jam\u00f3n, both were so salty I didn't finish either one. \n\nWe all chose to do the wine pairing, which actually had beer and cocktails in the pairing. The alcohol was fantastic, although they were a little skimpy on the pours. Towards the end of the evening, we all felt they were rushing us a bit. There was a couple that showed up 20+ minutes late for dinner, so we thought maybe they were trying to make up for that time, but not cool to punish the rest of us. \n\nReason for my 4 star rating? Everything was good, but it definitely wasn't mind blowing. Dinner, wine pairing and tax and service charge came to $416 a person. It just didn't match up. I didn't think what I had was worth it. Like I said, I didn't leave mind blown. I def wouldn't recommend someone trying this as their first tasting."
"1","I'm so sorry- I really wanted to like this restaurant. This was my second time here. \n\nThe first time I went with my husband on a weeknight in October and had good drinks at the bar with very bad overcooked brownish-black potato chips and lackluster dip. But I decided to give them another try. \n\nI went into Bootleggers this afternoon for take-out. The kid at the take out register was very courteous and prompt, and my PBLT sandwich was delivered to me very quickly.\n\nBut then I got home. I live three blocks away.\n\nThe sandwich was so greasy, it had turned the grilled sourdough into a soggy mess. The pork belly was primarily made up of gristle- so much so, that I had to take my sandwich apart, cut all the gristle off of the pork belly (which took up a third of my plate when I was done), and then reconstruct the whole thing. I was unable to finish the entire sandwich, it was just that bad. I couldn't touch the potato chips that accompanied the sandwich. My husband tried a few and told me they were cooked well this time, but were devoid of any flavor- including salt.\n\nTo make matters worse, half an hour after eating the sandwich I got really sick. Not sure if it was all that grease that made me ill, but unless the owner or manager contacts me and guarantees that things have changed, I will not be going back."
"2","My husband and I have been seeing Dr. Lida Raoufi at American Family Dentistry for a few years now.  We used to drive to the NW Valley and wanted something closer to home.  We hit the jackpot finding Dr. Raoufi.  She is very professional and at the same time treats you like family.  She actually met me at her office on a Saturday for an emergency appointment.  That's unheard of, right???  Her staff is very friendly and knowledgeable as well!  I would highly recommend this dentist office.  We won't go anywhere else!!"
"1","Terrible customer service. I would not suggest anyone to come here and specifically not to make this your personal archery spot. The staff was completely rude, and were insulting my equipment by saying that\""PSE is crap equipment that is made in China and notorious for being shitty\"" give me a break! What does this 20 year old kid know. Their other employees were no help and all just stood around the store waiting for something to fall in their laps. The rumors were true, this place is overpriced and has terrible service. Although I live 5 minutes away, I will not take my business there again"
"2","I always choose to go to Steve 's if I want to try something new.  The staff have always helped both my wife and I to find either new wine or new beer for us to try. They are always very knowledgeable and provide great customer service.  They have a great wine selection."
"2","There's still no grocery in the Hill, so many Hill residents come here by bus to do their shopping. There are always lots of folks standing around in the parking lot socializing, which brings a smile to my face. \n\nThe store itself is small by Giant Eagle standards so selection is limited, but I can't complain about having a major grocery store right in the heart of the south side. \n\nAlso, you can park in their lot on Friday and Saturday nights while you're partying it up on Carson Street. Ignore the signs about towing unauthorized cars - that has never been enforced."
"2","Great brunch but no alcohol!!! In any case I love their midwestern cuts of pork and excellent breakfast flavors. Busy and popular."
"1","Am I the only one seeing all the flies at the deli counter?!\nI really don't like this location. I always see flies, I can't get used to the layout, There's no Kids Korner, check out conveyor belts are usually dirty. \nThe location at 67th and Beardsley is awesome! Super clean, never saw a fly. Number system at the deli counter, Starbucks, and a  Kids Korner with stellar employees."
"2","I recently changed vets and am now a client of Aloha Animal Hospital. You would think my pup believes we are going to the park and not to the vet. This vet is clean and comfortable, my pup LOVES it here and so do I. The staff is grade A and I could not be more pleased with my vet swap. I will never venture from Aloha!"
"2","There are a number of ways to get around The Strip: walking, taxi, monorail, and the Deuce. We've done them all but the favorite is the Deuce. \n\nWalking in the heat = blisters and heat exhaustion (not to mention lots of aggravation from the uncountable numbers of unsavory characters hawking their mothers, sisters, and girl-cousins who, if you believe the advertising... are more than willing to sell their affection). \n\nTaxi = convenient and comfortable, but expensive. \n\nMonorail = fun but not really all that close to the attractions on the strip (see \""Walking in the heat\"", above). \n\nDeuce = conveniently located right on the strip, lots of stops at all of the casino/hotel's... and affordable. Probably the best bargain for transportation in LV. Conveniently located stops that are clearly marked. Easy ticket buying (machines or on-board). Frequent schedule (varies but is between every 10 to 15 minutes). Drivers were courteous and helpful. Extremely clean and air conditioned. Sometimes the bus got crowed. Wait time at stops varies depending on number of riders exiting and entering. Might not be the best option if one is on a tight schedule, but when touring and in no rush it is comfortable and convenient!"
"2","Overall, I would say they are probably my favorite pizza chain around.  Their pizza, breadsticks and wings are all good and their price is fair.  I consider them to be a much better option over something like Domino's or Pizza Hut, but my favorite pizza in the valley is still Brother's Pizza.  I would definitely recommend checking them out if you are in the mood for pizza.  They are my go-to choice for pizza night!"
"1","Underwhelming. I had the banana cream pie & the whole ensemble was tasteless: crust, custard, & cream were all bland."
"1","TOURIST TRAP. I found this restaurant online and my hotel room magazine. It had a pretty good number of reviews and apparently the first bar and restaurant in Pittsburgh so I added it to my Pittsburgh dinner options list. It turns out very few people in Pittsburgh or at least in our office actually knew this restaurant. It's an old, tiny restaurant located in the beautiful Market Square. It's so old school they only take cash! The place is called  \""Original Oyster House\"" but ironically they don't serve raw oysters, let alone decent oysters! They only have these mediocre breaded oysters that you can have in your sandwich or by themselves. Everything else is average. There is nothing special about this place except for the fact that it was the \""first restaurant\"" in Da Burgh as supported by the front door sign \""historical landmark.\"" If you're looking for good oysters, raw or not, or simply a good restaurant for lunch or dinner, this is definitely NOT the place."
"1","Hostess is awkward and not friendly . \n\nWe ordered jalape\u00f1os on our burgers and instead of coming to tell us they were out, she just put jabaneros on it, and didn't say anything . A mouth full of fire later I ask wtf and she says oh yeah we substitute ........ Thanks for asking me .  Additionally, neither burger had the bacon we ordered on it. \n\nPotato salad was good but served with plastic spoons? \n\nGarlic fries were soggy .\n\nFood was acceptable: I would try again. Can't speak for the wings."
"1","Pros: -Fast delivery within Squirrel Hill -Moderate prices -Fairly diverse menu (does not have regular omissions typical to Squirrel Hill Pizza shops) -Several healthier options available on menu -Discounts and coupons galore -Online ordering is quick and easy Cons: -Drinks forgotten on order (very common for delivery orders) -Pizza is alright but not \""good' -Hoagies/subs are pretty bad (cheap bread, very little cheese & rubberized meat) -Deserts come frozen with the wax paper included -Fries very tasty but pretty soggy as well. -Foreign delivery driver may have difficulty with delivery instructions. While this is still a new establishment, given the amount of direct competition in the immediate area I would have expected better. The delivery time for my order was truly excellent but in their haste they disregarded my drink order. The Driver did return however within several minutes after being chased down, but the drink he returned with was still a variation on my drink order. I would say that the quality of the food is OK, not incredibly good but certainly not the worse pizza in town. Also, their personal pizza options and late night delivery option make it an attractive choice for delivery. On my order the desert arrived mostly frozen and still wrapped in it's original freezer wax paper. Also the fries were placed in Styrofoam which makes them soggy. There are 3 types of Pizza Shops in Squirrel Hill: -Specialty (Mineo's, Aiello's, Napoli's, Lucci's) -Big Chain (Vocelli, Domino's, Pizza Hut) -Budget (Amier, Rialto, Italian Village, Bellino) Pizza Bellino definitely belongs to the later category. For me, when judging a Squirrel Hill budget pizza shop, I always use Pizza Amier as a comparison standard (since their prices are the lowest in the neighborhood). Are they more or less expensive then Pizza Amier? Does their product taste better than Amier? Does the taste justify the cost? While they do offer a tasty product and some more diverse menu options than Amier, I do not feel that the taste justifies the cost in this instance. I would not recommend this Pizza Shop. However, if had no other option I wouldn't consider it out of the question either."
"1","I have been a \""regular\"" customer at this salon ever since it opened.  At first it was great!  Clean, relaxing, and welcoming.   After a few months without a manicure or pedicure I decide to treat myself to a manicure this past week.  I went in and a lady did a beautiful job on my gel manicure.  She paid attention to detail and didn't rush through the whole process.  I didn't have time to get a pedicure so I decided to come back the next day.  I only wish that I had her do my pedicure yesterday ... \n\nThe guy who did my pedicure had some sort of infection on his thumb.  I didn't notice it at first because he was using gloves but when it was time for the foot massage he took his gloves off, revealing it.  Tracy was doing someone else's nails right in front of me and clearly saw that he had some sort of sore or fungus on his nail.  It was completely black and it looked like something was growing out of it.    I was shocked that she didn't tell him to at least put his gloves back on.  The \""massage\"" that he gave me was hardly any massage at all.  He did the same motion over and over while concentrating on the tv.  Definitely not worth the $25.   The worst part is that he gave me an ingrown toe nail.  The whole right side of my nail is swollen and I just hope that I don't get an infection.  This was by far the worst pedicure that I have ever received. Even though I had a great gel manicure here, my last experience was so horrible that I will not be back."
"1","Yes...Domino's...you still Suck!! Stopped eating here for awhile because it was mostly just bread...then tried again after they \""claimed\"" they got better....still gross. Not impressed. Even my 6 year old wouldn't eat it, claiming it wasn't pizza! lol No more money lost to these guys.."
"2","I love this place for lunch and takeout for dinner. They always have very fresh food and great prices too. They work hard to fill your order promptly."
"2","What a beautiful place!  I had lunch here earlier this week and couldn't get over how spectacular this place is!  The food was good, the service was good, but the atmosphere was amazing!"
"2","Good drink specials and yummy appetizers, great music playing and very attractive servers - could not complain a bit!  They were really nice and accommodating to our large group.  Really nice day at this place.  Wish they had their misters installed though!"
"1","I find every sauce to be extremely salty...ruins almost every dish...but the bang bang shrimp is still a winner if you want an app and a beverage"
"1","way oversold, extremely long lines at every wine station, and many stations ran out of wine early in the night! Lake las vegas is a great location and the night was very beautiful. If i could do it over again, I would buy a few nice bottles of wine with the $60 i spent there and drink them with my date at lake las vegas, as there is no admission fee into the grounds. hope this helps"
"2","I am not much of the sports bar type. But after one experience here I was amazed. The service is great and they offer free pick up and drop off shuttle service within a five mile radius so no holding back necessary"
"2","Aside from customer service, I really do love Pet Club. They have a lot of natural foods and treats you may have a difficult time finding elsewhere. It is a little pricy but you get what you pay for. This is why I'm giving four stars instead of one. This is the first experience I've had trouble here, however I don't believe I'll be back at this location. \n\nSuper annoyed. This experience happened today 9/26 at around 2:15. I'd first like to mention that Logan was wonderful. Very friendly and helpful. Her manager however is a piece of work. Instead of admitting that he did not follow through with ordering a large bag of rabbit formula for me as they kindly do he not only threw his lovely employee, Logan under the bus (IN FRONT OF HER AND OTHERS), he then told me that there is a shortage on rabbits. Seriously? We all know how quickly they procreate. He then lead me to another brand of rabbit formula which was $30 more than the brand I was hoping for. Come on guy. He was hardly helpful and left Logan at the front calling another store for what I was looking for after telling her she's not on her game. The outcome? They had it and had no idea what he was talking about. \n\nCrazy unprofessional. I've worked for people like him and it's just not right. Own up to a silly mistake buddy... I wonder how many people you've undermined for your own well being."
"1","Hit up Surrender to see Calvin Harris LDW. Personally I think the venue was a bit too small for him. The inside section was over crowded and people were pushing. Just seemed way too much. \n\nThe space itself is average inside. The outdoor section is massive but you can't see the DJ if you're outside. Spent most of my time here vying for space and waiting for Harris. Not even enough space to dance on the dancefloor. Bummer. \n\nProbably won't go back, there are better venues."
"2","Came here with some friends after work to sit on the patio and share a few bottles of wine. This was a great place and excellent environment. Really broad range of wines to choose from and beers too. Hate the uncorking fee which seems a little exorbitant  on top of an already expensive bottle of wine...\n\nAlso at the sliders which were decent. I would come here again. Also a good place to bring babies and dogs on the patio which is what our group did."
"2","I'm looking to get more high end cookware for my cooking and came here just to have a look around and check out an exclusive Le Creuset item they have.\n\nWalked in and was quickly helped by a gentleman named Don who was extremely experienced. I asked him nearly every question I had and he spent a solid 20 minutes with us giving his opinion on what I should do. \n\nHe emphasized that he didn't work on commission and really wanted us to take our time in deciding which gave our experience a really nice, no pressure feel. \n\nEnded up getting the Le Creuset item I had been looking at and Don will be my go to guy when I can make my way over there in the future.\n\nOnly thing keeping this from being 5 stars is that their prices are ridiculous in my opinion and would only be able to justify buying something there if it was on sale... which is just what I did :)."
"1","Pushy annoying sales people. Overpirced Prices more than doubled in last year. Unprofessional employees rude, arrogant and disrespectful attitude. I would not buy from them if they were the only choice! HIgh turn over of staff says a lot about the company. Too many choices out there to waste your time with this racket."
"1","Decoration are very dusty.  Bathroom was not very clean.  After waiting for  1 hr for menudo, finally had enough of waiting.  Went to ask what was taking so long.  Informed that \""menudo was not ready\"".  Checked their health department grade and they got a \""c\"".  Will not be eating that menudo after all."
"1","I take my Yelp reviews very seriously.  To me, giving someone a one star yelp review means that they have done something so egregious, that someone either did or could have gotten hurt as a result.  Oh wait...that's exactly what happened.  I recently flew into Phoenix with my brother, his husband and their 11 month old baby for a family wedding.  We rented an SUV with a car seat.  Initially, my brother asked if the car seat could be installed for them, as they were unfamililar with this model, and they were told company policy dictates that they could not install the seat.  Fine.  No big deal.  We install the seat and off we go to our hotel to rest up for the drive to Sedona the next day.  \n\nMy brother's husband had a nagging feeling about the seat that just wouldn't go away.  Finally, he drove to the local police station to have it inspected and we were informed that Hertz had neglected to include the base of the carseat and that it was in fact, unsafe to hold a child.  A quick call to Hertz later and I KID YOU NOT, we were informed that it was not negligence on their part, it was negligence on our part for driving off with the car seat that they had provided.  Are you counting?  We have two strikes so far.  Massive error that could have led to death of child (that's gotta count for at least 10 strikes though...right) and then complete failure to take responsibility or attempt to fix the problem.  The bro in law located a nearby Hertz location, and they said we could come and pick up a new seat.  They gave us a new seat, they sure did.  Once again, I kid you not, this one was missing clips.  \n\nWe made our way back to the original Hertz location at the airport.  The staff were rude, and spent a great deal of time rolling their eyes at us when we asked them for assistance putting a strange car seat into a car that we'd never seen before.  I understand they can't actually install it for liability purposes, but I can't believe that no one else has struggled to install an unfamiliar seat in an unfamiliar car.  Regardless, we never once received an apology, just continued rude behavior and eye rolls.  I travel often and have never encountered such poor customer service and lack of concern for safety at a car rental agency.  You can be sure that Hertz will never receive mine, my family's or any of my friends' business again.  You can bet that they will never receive the business of random people who I run into on the street.  This is how infuriated I am by their negligience and egregious mishandling of the whole situation."
"1","Disgusting;  we just stopped in for an early dinner (4:00 p.m. Sunday evening) and went into the bar so we could watch the games.   There were two gals and a guy behind the bar, just chatting between themselves, and a few other patrons.   Every table that was empty was dirty, the bar had dirty dishes piled on it.   When we let it be known that we wanted to sit,and to please clean a table, we received so much attitude that the three of us walked out.   Obviously no management was on site, one of the gals (heavy, long curly hair) was extremely rude.   \n\nI'm so disappointed as I live in the same neighborhood but won't be going in there again.   If it's that filthy in front of customers, omg what does that back kitchen area look like? \n\nAll three of those employees should have been fired on the spot; as it was we ended up going to Tommy's and had a clean fabulous atmosphere in their bar area with much better food.   Thank you Tommy's.."
"2","This location is new and I absolutely love it!  Location, staff, clear cameras, clean play areas and furniture, they got it all.\n\nThere is also a free evaluation for your little one on the first visit.  Because this place is so new, there are not as many dogs as the Las Vegas location.  However, my little girl had a good time because the handlers there are so interactive.  I can see on the cam on my app, how much attention the handlers give her.  They pet her, give out commands, and she follows.  When we brought her home, she went to find her bed and plopped on it.\n\nAfter the evaluation, we quickly booked her overnight stay for St. Paddy's Weekend.  Because the little one play hard, I made sure the staff document my request.  The staff prints out the overnight campers card and jot down the amount of food to give Dolce, how many times a day, how she should rest for 20 minutes after 45 minutes of play.  They are very detailed and accepted my little girl with kindness.\n\nWhen Earl and I went to go pick her up, we even requested for a tour of the camp.  There is a room for tiny dogs, a play area for small dogs, another for medium dogs, and a bigger play area for large dogs.  Those areas also have another part that dogs are allowed to go outside for some VITA D.\n\nWe definitely feel not so guilty for leaving our baby here.  She is well taken care of."
"2","Mexican food at its best. The restaurant atmosphere is family friendly. Great place to dine before or after badger games. The staff is friendly and attentive. However, when the restaurant is full of badger faithfull, you can bet you will need to be patient. It gets loud with excited fans ready  to munch on some delicious mexican food. I love the enchilada verdes with a side of mole. All the burritos re great and they cater to vegetarians and vegans alike."
"1","It took almost an hour for them to make 2 burgers. Worst service I've had in a long time!"
"1","Decided to shop at Target rather than Walmart, to find a better selection of hair clippers for my husband. Purchased a set, got hone and opened the box to find that they had been previously owned and well USED by someone else (complete with hair and even some dandruff). I called the store immediately and asked for the manager. I was then asked by a store employee to leave a message and I said no, I needed to speak with the store manager as soon as possible...about a complaint! The manager I spoke with could care less and didn't even apologise. Highly disappointed with this stores quality control, apparently someone in the Returns Department was slacking off. Needless to say the item was returned and I wouldn't be surprised if its waiting on the shelf for some other poor individual to purchase."
