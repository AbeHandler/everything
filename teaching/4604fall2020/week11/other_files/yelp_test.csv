"1","HORRIBLE customer service! I called to make an appointment and was told by the manager (Cherice) at the first number I called that they would honor my groupon for 2 different people (my husband and myself) to get massages, instead of buying another groupon. She couldn't fit me in though, so I was told to call another location. The other location didn't have any availability either, but she told me their third location would definitely. I called them (702-570-6587) and told her what the manager had told me about honoring the groupon. She told me she would call and check. She called back and told me the manager NEVER said that, and that they wouldn't honor my groupon. I called the manager back, and she verified what she had told me, and told me that she hadn't spoken with anyone about it. I called Lauren back, and she verified that Cherice is the one she spoke to. \n\nI WILL not ever use this salon. They call customers liars and can't get their story straight. Horrible customer service.\n\nEDIT 9/6/13 - the manager did respond to my review, and has apologized, but I still stand behind my review. Lauren may not have use the word 'liar', but she did insinuate that I was lying, and flat out lied to me twice."
"1","My car left dirtier than it arrived. They do offer a Veteran's and Senior Citizen discount for 10 dollars. I'll have to find a different spot to wash the Whip."
"2","Great service, really great wine, good steak....what's not to like? I highly recommend the bleu cheese steak (also the bleu cheese martini). Always love coming here."
"2","Let's get to the punchline and I'll give you the story in a moment.  This guy is a genius,  he saved my computer,  worked a miracle,  and saved my holiday.\n\nI'm from out of town on a deadline.  I call Wayne at 7pm and say I need my computer fixed can you take a look?  I drive over to his  home/office and tell my sob story of having a 12 noon deadline tomorrow.  He tells me that he can't make any promises but he will try.  Over the course of the next two hours he completely reconfigures my mother board and saves me weeks (everyone said they'd have to ship it out to the manufacturer).  I can't believe he fixed the computer and he didn't even have his full ensemble of tools.  Also the price was more than reasonable given the situation.  \n\nI can't recommend him highly enough.  A miracle worker!"
"2","This is the kind of over the top dining that I like to treat myself to once in a while. Gorgeous white tablecloth service, servers in white sportscoats, beautiful bar. I wish I could have spent 3 hours drinking my way through the meal and probably will allow myself that much time next visit. \n\nI had the 12oz bone in filet, it was excellent. Our table ordered the gnocchi & crab as a side dish. Delicious even for $26.  \n\nIt's a tiny bit awkward that it's in the middle of a massive shopping mall, for this kind of evening I wish I could just put on a nice dress and heels, take a cab and have a doorman open the restaurant door for me instead of trekking through a gi-normous mall up and down escalators to get there. However they make up for it with a cool bar and outstanding service."
"1","I went for breakfast with my gf and we were quite disappointed. We ordered an omelet and it was cold. The potatoes that came with the omlet were also cold.  The coffee was relatively hot. It wasn't worth the $30 that's for sure. I could have made a better breakfast myself in 10 minutes."
"2","This location feels like the perfect spot for a TJs.  It just fits the area, we have been to the one at Arrowhead and it feels a little out of place up there.  But at Camelback and 20th its just the right fit.  I always like to buy one new thing when doing a large grocery shop and am always pleased!  \nHere are a few of our Favs: \nPeanut Butter Cream Cheese\nFresh Motz Cheese Balls \nChocolate Jo Jos\nGarlic Herb Pizza Dough\n\nThese are just to name a few.  Trader Joes knows how to do a unique, fun, healthy market."
"1","Went to Pho Nam Noodle House with The Wife for Mother-To-Be's Day. The service was good and the food came out REALLY quickly, but, unfortunately, the food was severely lacking in flavor.\n\nThe Vietnamese Spring Rolls (#2) were good, but the sauce's flavor was really weak and what little flavor the sauce did have was overpowered by the spring rolls themselves. If you know me, you know that this is a problem since I LOVE sauce.\n\nThe Wife had the Pho with Beef (well-done flank) (#9), which she enjoyed; however, I tried it and was not impressed. The beef was flavorless, so the only flavor in the dish came from the lemongrass broth, which I found boring and \""flat.\""\n\nI ordered the Beef Vermicelli Noodles (#25) which comes with stir fried lemon grass beef topped with peanuts and vegetables. When the dish was placed on the table, I was disappointed to discover that there was almost no beef in it. Seriously, there were maybe eight SMALL strips of beef and that was it. Needless to say, I didn't find the meal satisfying ... My dish also came with a small bowl of sauce on the side, which was lucky because the dish itself had literally NO sauce on it. NONE. After dumping the entire bowl of sauce onto my meal, I was again disappointed to discover that it was totally flavorless. Even The Wife, who enjoys low-flavor foods, was surprised at how absolutely flavorless my meal was. I ended up having to douse the entire dish in hoisin sauce, which the restaurant luckily has on the table, to enjoy it.\n\nI will not return to Pho Nam Noodle House."
"1","My friend and I both used a GroupOn special today that included a blowout, deep conditioning treatment, and 5 minute scalp massage. \nTo start off, the receptionist and stylists both seemed beyond put off that we had walked in the door...even though we had made appointments. As I sat down, my stylist said \""you have a lot of hair. Great.\"" And rolled her eyes. Not \""Great!\"" as in what nice hair you have, but \""I can't believe I have to deal with this.\"" \nThings warmed up during the wash, and the scalp massage was great- although nowhere near 5 minutes long. \nShe did a good job styling my hair, but not the best I've seen. Best part was that my hair is still curly a few hours later, more than I can say for the DryBar. \nOverall a good turnout on both of our styles, but the experience wasn't great. I probably won't return. Had I paid the full $55 the service was worth, as opposed to the $22 pride I got with Groupon, I would have been more upset."
"2","Been to his karaoke spot 3 times and every single time I've had so much fun!!! All of their food is good, especially the hot wings and the French fries! They have a great selection of music. However, they don't have any salt and pepper music which I was kind of bummed about. Other than that the place is great! The employees are always so nice. The last I came with a bunch of friends, we ended up dancing in the lobby for an hour because the music was so good. Definitely a great place to come to with a group of friends to have some good ol fashioned fun!! Highly recommended. Side note: there's no age limit until 10pm, after that it's 18+."
"2","I wanted to end 2012 on a high note. In reality I ended 2012 on a high summit.\n\n  My original plan was to spend my ultimate hike of 2012 climbing up Frenchman Mountain. As the weekdays turned into the weekend, I thought that I could use just a bit more warming up before I returned to Frenchman Mountain. Lone Mountain would be my ultimate hike of 2012.\n\n   I have always been enchanted by Lone Mountain's setting on the Valley floor right off the 215.  This is one exit where nature dominates. Whenever I drove on the 215, I had been curious about this mountain that stands to the east of it between Lone Mountain and Alexander Roads. After doing my research, I was confident that  A) this would be an awesome hike and B) Lone Mountain deserved to be a hiking listing on Yelp.\n\n  The best way to describe Lone Mountain is visualizing an oval with the long sides being vertical. The oval would be surrounded by Alexander Road to the south, Jensen Street to the east, the 215 to the north, and Vegas Vista Street to the west. Between the roadways is a trail circumventing it with some homes sprinkled in. The top left of the oval (northwest) would be the Vegas Vista trailhead parking lot with the hiking trail to the top of the summit. On the right side of the oval is Lone Mountain Park.\n\n  I am a worrier when it comes to leaving my car in isolation. Especially when I am climbing up a mountain. Regardless that the closest parking facility is where Vegas Vista dead ends, I added extra miles to the hike parking at Lone Mountain Park. This gave me the perception that the people walking their dogs, spending time with their kids at the playground, and picnicking (maybe I should write a review on Lone Mountain Park) were extra eyes. The extra time that I spent walking on the perimeter trail halfway around around Lone Mountain provided me with nice pictures, an introduction to Lone Mountain, and anticipation. On the walk back to my car, I hiked the other segment of the perimeter trail. I enjoyed  looking up at where I just hiked, and seeing more of Lone Mountain. Prior to walking on the perimeter trail, I was unaware that Lone Mountain has trails leading to caves. I would not notice this if I just got back in my car. Sundown is the best time for an extended walk around Lone Mountain on the perimeter trail.\n\n  The best way to describe the hike on Lone Mountain is that it is two hikes. Hike one took me on an east ascent to the lower summit. There is a bench (with graffiti) to sit back end enjoy the view. On the right will be hike two, which is up the south accent to the higher summit. If I was really up to it, I could of walked higher and reached a third summit.\n\n   Lone Mountain is no joke. I am so happy that I brought along a hiking pole. It literally saved me from some falls. My hiking philosophy is that three legs are better than a broken leg. Throughout the trail, there are steep inclines with loose rock and gravel. In some spots, the rocky steps require a hiking pole. For the record, there are spots on Lone Mountain without a barrier to prevent a fall. If the weather was warm, I certainly would of brought along water. Vegetation is relatively nonexistent on Lone Mountain. On warm days dehydration is another concern.\n\n   The view from the top of Lone Mountain is so worth the hike. I came to the realization that the views from the shorter summit is just as good as the higher summit. The only flaw was that I could not see the south valley. Most likely if I kept climbing to the highest point, I would look down on all of the valley below. What I saw was breathtaking views of the Strip, downtown, and the north valley.\n\n   I give Lone Mountain 4 stars. Thanks to Lone Mountain, I ended 2012 on a high note."
"2","Very good and has a really good variety of meats you can try."
"2","Phat Burrito's burritos are just that: Phat. And, depending on how you order them, they're Fat too. And really, there's no reason to order anything else. \n\nChoose from BBQ Chicken, Steak, Chicken, Fish and Grilled Veggies (the girlfriend's pick every time). Surprisingly, the fish is excellent--and at a really good value. It's like a blackened Tilapia and comes with a pineapple-y salsa. Extremely tasty. Everything else is good as well--and you can add beans (black, spicy red or refried) for no additional cost. Go with the spicy red; you won't be disappointed. The guacamole isnt anything special, but it's fresh and tasty, so throw that on your burrito as well. \n\nGrab a Modelo as your cerveza and you're all set to enjoy the funky decor of the spare inside. Outside seating is perfect for a warm evening, and there's often a mellow hipster crowd out there enjoying itself. \n\nLife is Phat."
"1","Well... Decor is neat, food is decent, the price is right and I guess ignorant service is part of the deal.\n\nService is not terrible, but forgotten stuff, cluelessness of our waiter, her fake, robotic smiles and overall slowness and mix-ups were very annoying.\n\nThe real question: can we expect better service at this price? And my answer is: probably not, but...\n\nMy advice to the boss: simplify you menu, educate your staff, stop pretending that you're higher-end than you really are and everything will feel much smoother for us, your customers."
"2","Ate at La Hacienda on Thanksgiving Eve. Truly exceptional food and service. Expensive but worth it.    \n\nWe made a meal for four from appetizers. All were exquisite. Guacamole sampler was inventive. Empanadas were wonderful. Best of all the sweet corn tamales. Chocolate flan was sinful."
"2","We just happened to wander our way and found this place, and boy, am I glad we did. \n\nWe thought it was funny that we're ordering at the NUMBER ONE BOBA PLACE, but it lived up to its name, forelios. \n\nI got the papaya milktea thingy majingy (forgot the exact name), but it was SOOOO GOOD. Best boba I've had in a long time! All my friends loved the drinks that they ordered too. It was so fresh and they used real fruits! Loved it.\n\nI can't wait to come back to Vegas and get some good boba milktea. And to party of course haha."
"1","We ordered lunch from Indian Curry Bowl yesterday, and I can't say enough about how HORRIBLE it was.  Not just the food, but the entire experience.  The food was very overpriced.  For 2 entrees, 1 side, and 2 orders of Samosas, the total came to $72!!  I was shocked, and looked over the receipt.  They were charging me $10 for chutney??!?  I eat Indian food from many different establishments on a regular bases, and the chutney is ALWAYS complimentary.  It's like charging for ketchup.  \n\nWhile I was waiting for my order, I was watching the elderly woman prepare the food using...... a microwave.  Really?  No burners or stoves going, just a couple of microwaves.  The food was not good at all.  The Samosas were soggy and undercooked, the Chicken Tikka Masala and Saag Paneer were runny and looked like they literally had been mixed with water.  \n\nSo basically, I paid over $70 for food that was microwaved (seriously, I'm still appalled by that one) and terrible.  Never again!!!!"
"2","I had a good experience with the Conscious Carnivore. We ordered a 6lb beef tenderloin for our annual Christmas party. I called about a week beforehand, asked for the price of the beef, and the young woman on the phone couldn't answer me for sure. She offered to call back with pricing, and I said that was fine. She did return my call and tell me the price, which was satisfactory to me. So I ordered the tenderloin and specifically told her that I wanted it to be a whole 6lb tenderloin (not two three-pound tenderloins, for example).\n\nUnfortunately she either didn't listen, didn't write it down, or it got lost in translation somewhere. When my husband went to pick it up, it was two three-pound tenderloins. I was pretty unhappy because I had specifically asked for a whole one and the woman on the phone said that that would not be a problem. \n\nThe quality of the meat was excellent, and the butchers go out of their way to make sure the meat is tied correctly for even cooking. That is a HUGE plus in my book. In addition, they make sure all the silver skin is off the beef, which is, again, a huge plus. Everyone at my party complimented the meat and asked where we got it, and it was tender and delicious even though I overcooked it slightly. I would definitely go back to the Conscious Carnivore again, but I don't know if I'd order a big cut of meat again because I'm not willing to chance that the order gets messed up."
"2","Listen,  I cant put into words of wisdom what I experienced here, all I can say is GO!  Stop reading all the reviews and just experience the place for yourself. The 5 stars is from a guy who just loves to eat great food.... I've traveled all over and have eaten at fancy restaurants without having 1/2 the experience I had at Barrymore's. The strip is loaded with big name chefs turn restaurateurs and some have succeeded and some have failed. The key to surviving in sin city is not your celebrity name, who you know and blah, blah, blah...\n\n\n\nTaste, Quality, depth, creativity, comfort and off the hook-great service-BAM!\n\n\nThe Barrymore has it all-\n\n\n\nI'm done..........exit, stage left!\n\nJUST GO!"
"1","I'd visited the Sugar Factory a few years ago once before and had a similar \""meh\"" experience. I thought that things might have improved, but alas, no such luck.  It appears that they've scaled back their menu, at least in terms of entrees. They still have the large selection of specialty drinks and desserts, however. Entrees ranged from $15-$30, which seemed pretty high for this type of restaurant. \n\nWe visited with a group of 5 friends on a Sunday afternoon.  It was extremely busy, so there was a bit of a wait. I liked the new system of giving the hostess your cell phone number so they could text you when your table was ready (although I hope that's not a marketing ploy and they don't text all the time with \""specials.\"").  Our table was right by the bar, which wasn't my preference, but given how busy it was, I didn't mind terribly.\n\nOur server took quite awhile to come to take our drink orders. I was the only one to order a non-alcoholic drink, and my beverage arrived last- in fact, I had to remind her of it.  She wasn't particularly friendly; she just seemed stressed.  The food similarly took quite awhile. I ordered the turkey club sandwich, which given the description, I expected to be served warm. While the bread was somewhat warm, imagine my surprise when I bit into it and was greeted with cold meat and fixings.  The fries were just fine. \n\nThe server did not ask if we preferred the check to be split, so of course there was some confusion when it arrived. She was able to split it for us, but seemed really put off by it.  There also was an 18% gratuity already added (I'm assuming that is for groups of 6 or larger). Luckily I saw it before I paid, so I didn't double tip.  However, paying $30 for a lackluster sandwich, fries, and a Pepsi, along with a server who would have rather been doing something else, is not the way I prefer to spend a Sunday."
"2","Ate there for the first time in a while. Many people I know, like the place, others just don't. We've never had bad food there. During busy season, expect to spend 90 minutes from start to finish. This is not a service problem, but a kitchen issue. The orange roughy was not good, it was SUPERB, and the chicken stir fry, very good. Food was served warm, and the service provided by Jeff was exemplary. There has been an influx of younger servers who are extremely effective, accomodating, and polite. You get a big bang for your buck. Based on our experiences, it would seem that the negativity is unwarranted."
"1","I wish I could give a minus 5.  This was the most unorganized set up I've seen in a while.  We had to stop here on the way back from Mexico.  It took so long to get through Immigration and Customs, I swear the employees were on some kind of slow motion drugs.  We were about to miss our flight- in fact someone had to call the gate to ask them to wait for us.  When we saw the mile long line for security, we panicked.  I thought if I asked the security man very nicely if we could go to the head, since the plane was waiting, perhaps he would help us.  WRONG!!!  He was the rudest, most ignorant employee I encountered in the entire airport.   We ran our asses off and got to our gate just as they were closing the doors.  Luckily they let us board.  From now on it's non-stop for us!!!"
"1","0 stars! Show turned off 5 min in! Worst Vegas show experience ever! So disappointed. May never book another Vegas show again. Thanks for nothing Mandalay Bay"
"1","The owner, Mrs. Kim is not a tailor, do not give her your clothes to work on them. She doesn't know how to take measurements, and she opened a hole in my shirt with her scissors. This is the worse experience of customer service I have had, she refused to reimburse me for the tailoring job. \nTheir prices are low but sometimes they don't do a good cleaning job on white shirts. I don't think they use adequate detergent."
"1","Came in almost 20 mins ago after getting seated... the waitress never acknowledged us... did not greet us or ask us to wait a moment.  We just sat there for over 20 mins... no water nothing just to see people just come in after us and get their order taken as soon as they sat down. A lady who seem to be in regular clothes possibly a supervisor finally came over.  So I complained and told her what happened with the people who got their order taken I told her I'm just going to order everything now.  Today is ihop's sweet 56... which I just turned sour for.  56 cent pancakes...  it was probably worth it just to run over to dennys.  There is no excuse no matter how busy... and slow your service is and understaffed for the event that you cannot greet everyone when they sit and let them know u will be with them shortly... its just common courtesy.  A guy behind us was upset and got out loud about it.  Some people just left their money at the pay counter because nobody was there to ring them up.  What an easy opportunity to get robbed.  Ihop get your sh*t together and all your staffed properly trained because your horribble service is insulting and degrating to customers like me who go and eat out a lot."
"2","The food here was great! We had the red curry with beef and yellow curry with chicken. Both were delicious and the perfect amount of heat thanks to the recommendation of the owner. The restaurant sits in an almost empty shopping center and there isn't signage you can see from the street. We have lived in the area 3 years and had no idea it was ever here. Thanks to Yelp we found this great place. The owner and family were there including their friendly young son. He was entertaining and trying to play with our son, it was sweet. We will be back."
"2","Brought my parents here for their 37th Wedding Anniversary and it was such a great experience! The food and service is truly impeccable and probably one of the best Mexican restaurants I have been to a long time. We ordered several of their Taco's a la carte and all were fantastic. Amazing spicy Serrano margaritas to accompany the food. I can't wait to visit my parents and go back to place!"
"2","My wife and I had the family dinner. The sizzling rice soup alone was worth the trip. The PooPoo platter was just OK--nothing spectacular, but by the time our entrees arrived we were pretty full. We had Moo Goo Gai Pan and Orange Beef with Pork fried rice. All were superlative. We got a total of 5 meals out of it. Highly recommended, bring lots of hungry people and don't over-order. We will be back to explore the. menu. Really more like 4-1/2 stars."
"1","Wow, almost hate to do this but I've eaten here many times. The cook seems to have a real attitude. The wait staff are very pleasant as is the owner and his family. Today, I found crushed egg shells in my German pancake and the cooks response was: \"" there's a lot of eggs that go into them so that will happen\"". Not the reply I was expecting. This , unfortunately , was not the first time that I found something\"" other than\""in my food. The last time it was hair. I doubt I'll be returning anymore."
"1","Whatever you do , do not use the roadside assistance, they contract with a company called Agero and my husband was on the side of the road for 7 hours in 105degree heat waiting for a tow truck .Every time we called they said the trucks on the way. We have been members for over 25 years and have at least eight different products through USAA. I guess you get what you pay for, since its free, that's what you get very bad service. The day after that happened we went to AAA and got membership, I know it would only take 30 minutes or less for tow with them!!!! Hope no one else goes thru what we did."
"1","My friend and I ate here for lunch on 10/31/14. Our waitress was Norma and she was excellent! First, I recommend you really read the menu board. ONLY Monday - Thursday can you get the lunch for $7.95. Otherwise, it's nearly triple the price! \n\nBeer is cheap! $4.00. We ordered the Oyster Rockefeller and it was good. You get 6 large baked oysters for $15. Next, we ordered the Combo Pan roasted shrimp and crab. It was good and hot. However, it doesn't come close to the pan roast at Ocean Trail in Scottsdale -- which is my No. 1 favorite. You will have to do a lot better to pass Ocean Trail. But overall, it was OK. Nothing remarkable; a bit pricey for what you get. Total tab for lunch was $73.00 without tip. That was with only 1 beer and 1 wine."
"2","Jorge and his team are awesome. They were professional and did clean work. \nJorge came over and took measurements of the area that where we would want to put the gate. He showed us samples that were recognizable from around our neighborhood. We got online with his website and picked out different examples we thought we would like for our own home. He gave us a rendering and we may have gone back three or four times with different changes. He was completely open to making any alterations that we requested. He kept reminding us that this is our gate and we will be looking at it. \nExcellent work. We will use his services in the future."
"1","I had loved this place (read my earlier review). However, they have been trying too hard to the point of being pretentious. I have tried taking my colleagues to this place for a happy hour at 5pm and despite having an empty restaurant at that time, they were playing hard to fit a group of 6 people (we were flexible to split into two groups as well). Leaving that incident aside, I met up with a friend last evening at the bar area and again had a bad experience. Also, they were the first restaurant I have seen in Pittsburgh to charge me two bucks for ice to go along with my whiskey! Thanks but no thanks!"
"1","First time and last...very dissapointed w service and food not good at all...guess that we are  not coming back. Joe's Crabs is.the best."
"1","Was treated with total disrespect by a female employee when I asked if they had another color of a shoe in stock. She told me color doesn't matter but the shoe does. I know that (duh) but I still want my shoes to look good on me. Don't treat me like a second rate citizen because I care about the color.  This particular person was very snooty. I will not support a place that treats their customers like dirt."
"2","Yummy, cheap, and clean! Love the revolving bar too! My husband and I end up going here almost every date night just because we love it so much. And we've tried other sushi places, they don't compare!"
"1","Horribly run business. They took money out of my account without my permission, i spent hours on the phone and they told me they would credit my account but i wouldnt recieve all my money back. No one would help me or return my phone calls."
"1","This new BBQ shack is hidden behind Crepes Mille and Perla.  Try to find it, it's quite an adventure.  Hopefully they will move a bit more out into the open!\n\nThey offer a nice variety of BBQ meats, in taco form or plate form.  Cheap too.  I got the brisket, chicken, and fish.  Yep, SMOKED fish taco.\n\nThe brisket and chicken were both a bit dry and underseasoned, but the fish was moist, and tender, though a bit fishy.\n\nTry it out, see if you like it.  Wasn't too impressed.  Seems pretty new, maybe they'll work out some of the kinks in the meat."
"2","Drop the convenience and you got yourself an all-start liquor store. For some reason, walking in and seeing bags of chips, slim jims and shampoo does nothing for me. So, going forward, I shall call this place \""Star Liquor Store.\"" And what better name to have on Yelp, eh? Especially when the booze selection earns 5 Yelp stars. \n\nI'll un-cap (get it?) the star-worthy appeal:\n+They sell the White Chocolate Ale from a local AZ brewery (it's amazing)\n+You can pick up a single pint glass or beer mug (wine glasses too)\n+They carry Rogue and most all other major West coast breweries\n+Their wine selection is impressive and they have liquor too!\n+Their prices are competitive and cheaper than BevMo\n\nThis is fast becoming my fave spot to stop. You won't have to fight the noise or crowd of Papago to pick up a 6-pack. And the owners are super nice with excellent service.\n\nCheck out their site: http://www.starlc.com/"
"1","Though I like the pharmacist, the pharm techs at this location have the WORST customer service! Several times they did not fill my Rx within 24 hours, for different reasons. Never did they call me or my doctor and try to resolve the situation ... they just waited till I showed back up to inform me there was a problem. No apologies, not even a smile. \n\nThe pharmacist once overheard me telling the tech that I had come back three times and my Rx still hadn't been filled. He offered me a gift card and apologized for my trouble, and I was very grateful. But really, me having to return three times for an Rx I fill every month? Inexcusable. \n\nOnce I walked up to the RX counter inside the store to ask where to find an OTC medicine. I was sick, could barely function, and the tech didn't even look up from her cell phone ... she just said, \""Isle ten.\"" I said, \""I looked in isle ten and didn't see it.\"" She totally ignored me and kept texting!! I muttered, \""Thanks for nothing,\"" and stumbled away. Thankfully the same sweet pharmacist saw the interaction and dropped what he was doing to come and help me. \n\nThere's a creepy tech with a greezy skullett that is rude every time (he has screwed up my Rx twice). Now he just takes my money and shoves my Rx through the window at me. \n\nIf it wasn't for the exemplary pharmacist, and the close proximity to my house, I would never return to this location."
"1","Blended coffee drinks--too sweet\nTea--the flavor didn't taste pure (I am a tea snob).  \nPrice--ugly ($5.95+ per cup)\n\nIf the quality was better, I would be happy to pay more.  However, even with the convenience factor of being an elevator ride away, I still will refuse to go here.  Starbucks has better tea.  For better (Lavazza) coffee, go to the coffee shop Presso by taking the elevator to the Palazzo shops.  Pricey still but better quality. \n\nP.S. Upon checking in at the Palazzo the passport has a B1G1 free coupon.  Very restrictive on what you can use and I would rather pay more for better coffee!\n\nService--nice person ad the front, but the machine which charges to your room was not functioning, so that was annoying.  I also was not too happy about the restrictions placed on type of drinks...given that it's the same price, and your margin is high, why does it matter whether my choice is \""seasonal?\""  You are practically turning away business!\n\nWill not be back..."
"2","Given the paucity of good craft beer selections in Vegas, this place gets a high star rating.  Prices are reasonable for Vegas too, considering that many of these same beers would cost you the same price in a top notch beer bar that isn't in a city like Vegas.  They were open mid morning which was perfect for me to enjoy my Dogfish Head Pale Ale shortly after breakfast.  Bar is made of cracked glass fragments that is quite cool."
"2","For Vegas, the pricing is pretty decent. A little less than $20 for a very nice burger. I ordered a medium rare burger and it came out ever so slightly overdone, but still very juicy and embarrassing to eat. Everyone I dined with (5 people) was pleased with their meal. Others ordered pizza, soup, pasta and a panini. Nothing was \""the best ever\"" but it was all solidly very good, and reasonably priced for lunch. Service was great too. Polite without being condescending."
"2","We went here for the first time last night and were pretty happy with everything. Our four year old son has every allergy imaginable except for nuts and eggs so this place sounded like a good idea. The service was very slow but the waitress was pleasant. We ordered all the appetizers except for one. The Quinoa Tabouli was yummy but a very small portion for $6. The Lemon Hummus did not have much flavor but came with a nice sized plate of veggies so we were alright with it. The Air-Fried Sweet Potato Fries were really good and a big hit with my son. The Veggie Pasta was my husband's and my favorite and a very close second for my son. The Three-Bean Chili was cold, too spicy and gross. They had 2 differect kinds of iced tea and they were both good and came with free refills. I have to give this place 4 stars because all in all, we were very pleased with our meal and experience here. We will be back to try some different dishes."
"2","I went for the gelato, and I was impressed with the imaginative flavors (red velvet cake...). I had pistachio, and my friend L.C. had cookies and cream. We also sampled butterscotch chip and a few sorbets. Everything was delicious.\n\nWe didn't have any coffee, but I will definitely try it next time I'm in the neighborhood. The barista / gelato schlepper (his description) seemed to be on his game and the coffee aroma was tempting.\n\nThe other reviews mentioned the chain pizza / rumpus room / rehab center picnic area decor. Yes, it's all true. With the power supplies (for laptops) above table level, the place also looks like the ship in The Matrix.\n\nBTW, the gelato end of the business is called Monster Gelato. Monster must be the name of a cat, as one scoop is called a \""kitty\"" (or maybe \""kitten\"") and the larger portions are identified as cat sizes. The place is eccentric -- but definitely independent!"
"2","This review is really for the service and Cuban Pork Sandwich.  It was SUBLIME and makes my list of best sandwiches EVER. I'd go back in an instant."
"2","Why would anyone give a bad rating to this M & M store?\n\n4 floors of chocolatey goodness and cute memorabilia... you can't go wrong.\n\nI really enjoyed the 3rd floor where they have the counter where you can personalize your m & m's.\n\nAnd really... nothing says I love you more than personalized Happy Anniversary m & m's :-)\n\nthey package them up and as long as you store them correctly, they're good for 1 year.  Perfect!  Just in time to get next year's anniversary chocolates!"
"1","I've only visited the attic on weekend nights, so I can't speak to the atmosphere on a more mellow night, but on weekends this place is slammed.\n\nYou get 2 for the price of 1 at The Attic, because it connects to Madison's. And when both places get crowded, watch out. The Attic is just too small for the amount of people they let upstairs, along with them trying to have a dance floor. It can take quite a while to get a beer at the bar cause of the crowd. And on a busy night, don't even try getting outside. If you aren't there early, just forget about it all together.\n\nPeople really do get into it on the dancefloor, so that can be an escape from the crowdedness around it. There seems to always be a wedding party here for some reason, so expect some dressed up drunken folk dancing away.\n\nThe Attic just gets too crowded for me & isn't really anything special. Just like Madison's, I'm not sure what their differentiating factor is to set them apart from other Charlotte bars, but it doesn't appeal to me if they have one."
"2","This is a very cool, relaxed atmosphere. The wait staff, managment staff, security was top notch. The food was PHENOMENAL! The price point was fair.  You must try their raw bar too.  We went twice in four days and the second evening from 9pm -10 pm (Wednesday) they offered $0.25 beer by this time I thought that I was at a nightclub in college.  \n\nIt's overall a great place to let loose, eat good, drink good and listen to great music and receive EXCELLENT guest service....\n\nBTW, I failed to mention that their portions are large and the presentation was quite impressive."
"2","saw a show at the glass nickel as part of a super cool yelp event (i'm told there are many). i was a virgin to all three.  cherry (tomato) (sauce) popped hours later, i'm driving home in the afterglow.  \n\nif u have a chance to catch their saturday night show DO IT!  and if u have a chance to volunteer to act out a scene with them, DOUBLE DOG DARE DO IT! \ni laughed so hard and loved it so much, i'm hooked and MBI is my pimp."
"2","If you want to change the way you look at Edinburgh, take a walk along the Leith walkway.\n\nIt's an absolutely gorgeous scenic route right through the heart of Edinburgh. Unlike the film depictions and misconceptions, you'll find yourself surprised and quite taken with the beautiful area, and seeing a side of Leith that you may never have seen before.\n\nThe walkway itself is picturesque, and since it's full of friendly dog walkers whenever I take a stroll , I feel quite safe walking along it by myself. I love diving out the city for a while into a calm, tranquil wonderland of green and grey-blue. For that it can't be beat. Definitely one of the best alternative ways to see virtually undiscovered parts of the city."
"2","Rachel's Kitchen is a wonderful place for brunch and the menu has something for everyone. As a local, I enjoy this location in Henderson and all of the shopping that surrounds it. Don't forget the happy hour specials for half-priced mimosas!"
"2","Went back to Arcadia's Wildflower Bread Company today for a farewell lunch for a coworker.  I started Weight Watchers on Sunday, so I prepared by going to the Wildflower website and calculating the \""points\"" from their nutrition pages.  Thanks, Wildflower, for making that info available.  But, Holy Cats!  My friend had urged me to try their salads, which she loves.  The two salads for which I calculated \""points\"" totalled 22 and 23 points.  My daily total is 29 points.  And salad is not great as a leftover.  I ended up with the vegetarian lentil soup.  I could eat the bread with butter and my total was still only 11 points.  Plus, I tried a new soup and am now a big fan of the tasty veggie lentil.  Parking was once again a challenge, but I was on my motor scooter, which enables me to improvise parking."
"1","They close by midnight. Maybe they should update their business hours both online and posted."
"2","I was at El Chorro for a wedding rehearsal dinner so my review is based on their private dining services and not the normal dining experience.\n\nUpon driving up to the restaurant there is a professional valet that quickly and efficiently gets you out of your car and on your way to a culinary adventure.  \n\nOur wedding party had a large private room off to the left of the main restaurant.  While walking over (on a hot and humid day) I noticed several huge mobile air conditioning units to cool the customers on the patio.  I was impressed by them because it's a thoughtful gesture that I haven't seen in many places.  These weren't the cheap (worthless) models.  They were some serious industrial A.C. units and they felt great.\n\nThe area we had was pretty secluded and private (away from the regular restaurant).  It had a great patio for cocktail hour.  The service was friendly and professional.  They were quick with drinks and quick to clean up empty glasses.\n\nThe dinner itself was magnificent.  We had a party of ~ 40 people but the service and the food was that of a quaint 5 star dining experience.  The deserts were so good I feared a massive sugar buzz so I had to contain myself (see my uploaded photos).\n\nOverall, it was a 5 star experience.  If anyone is considering having a private dinner here (wedding or otherwise) I'd highly recommend it.\n\nFantastic!"
"1","I stayed here a few years ago on my 2nd trip to Vegas. We wanted something cheap and we got it. The bed had cigarette stains and holes in it. the tropical decor was so cheesy. We were not in the room very much but when you have the spins from drinking it is not fun to hear the cars in the next door parking structure. It gave me motion sickness too. I threw up in the elevator, which is tiny and all through the casino. I will not go back here, bad memories, but everyone needs one really cheesy nasty vegas stay I guess.\n\nOh Yeah I guess they are planning on tearing it down for a new casino."
"2","\""The $17,000,000 Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars Palace offers a feast that boasts more than 500 options and may well take the ongoing battle of Las Vegas buffets to a new level. Bacchanal Buffet premiered on September 11th after a complete wall-to-wall renovation from the previous Lago Buffet and will likely become a culinary mainstay like the Carnival World Buffet, which opened over two decades ago.\"" - Chris Rauschnot, The Huffington Post\n\nSo good ol' rich Caesar decided he was bored of his crapLago Buffet [finally] and decided to do something with his endless stack of pure and unadulterated cash to fix the main culinary mess in his own backyard. Although having expected much less, pumping $17 million just means that from launch and to a certain extent of time...this buffet is going to be - for lack of better words - G.R.E.A.T. But this article also mentions the Carnival World Buffet (by the way, is no longer that great...) as a parallel, which serves one main point...this place will only be good for \""so long\"". SO GET YOUR GLUTTON ARSE OVER HERE QUICK...while it is still this freaking G.R.E.A.T.\n\nService is great as the staff definitely display their enthusiasm to work at the \""best buffet\"" in Vegas (loved how the cashier reiterated that to us SEVERAL times). Need refills? It comes automatically. Need your plates to disappear? No, you don't need to chuck it under the table...they efficiently disappear on their own - even if you're a speedy little punk like me (gone and back within a minute with another full plate).\n\nSo after coming here several times for both lunch and dinner, I would recommend lunch if you don't want to break your wallet since the difference between both meals is minimal. If you have the 24-hour-Buffet pass, please note that you'll need to pay an extra $16'ish bucks per entry.\n\nSummary of my main LIKES (this is what I come here for):\n\n- EVERYTHING AT THE CARVING STATION: really tender and juicy prime rib, fall off the bone baby back ribs, luscious lamb chops, sausages and more!\n- Steamed crab legs\n- Fresh raw oysters: one of few times I would recommend RAW oysters at a buffet (additional Japanese version at dinner)\n- GIANT cocktail shrimps...holy crap, these are the 5-8/lb types!\n- Ginseng chicken soup and Chinese BBQ (especially the char siew...gives Sam Woo a run for its money - now that's something)\n- Cheese and prosciutto section (used these on my salads)\n- Bottled fruit juices (lunch only)\n- DESSERTS: non-sweetened desserts such as the cheesecake was a plus for me!\n\nCaesar made the right decision with his \""back-anal\"" (bacch-anal) investment and is definitely raking in the profits once again to Rome. \n\nI definitely RECOMMEND this Vegas buffet (for now - before it eventually ends up like Carnival World Buffet)!"
"1","The parking is not that easy here, even if you arrived early.  I think that we ended up in someone's backyard lot.  It's not that close to the freeways.  But, catching the W.Sox v. Cubs game here for Spring Training is awesome!  However, don't get me wrong, it's not even a tenth as good as catching the rivalry in Wrigley (which I've done too), but close."
"2","Craftsteak is a very pricey but excellent steakhouse.  It's a beautifully warm, elegant setting, with d\u00e9cor mainly in dark shades, wood, and leather.  There're also beautiful, colorful, lively, fun paintings of cows -- yes, cows -- on the walls over the booths.  The staff is outstanding -- friendly, patient, helpful, knowledgeable, and efficient.\n\nThe menu is surprisingly large (I rarely see a menu this size at a place categorized as \""fine dining\""), as are the portions -- you won't go hungry here without trying, especially if you have a party of four or less and go with the family style option...sooooo much excellent food!  The food has great flavor, especially the meats (of course) and, surprisingly, the bibb salad, which had a light blue-cheese dressing that brought the components together perfectly.  The drinks list is HUGE, with especially extensive wine and scotch sections.\n\nMy one issue with Craftsteak is that I felt like it was very overpriced -- even though the quality is excellent -- especially the drinks.  (I knew the bottle prices of a few of the scotches on the list and the markup on a glass seemed ridiculously high to me.)"
"1","I took my new puppy here twice because everyone at PetSmart has been very friendly and helpful so I expected great service from pet hospital inside as well. I was very disappointed with with doctor I saw here, I should never have wasted my money the second time. It is obvious that this pet hospital is more concerned about getting as much money as they can out of you than rather than giving your pet the best care.\n\nBeing a new puppy owner I had a lot of questions and trusted what the doctor was saying. He suggested giving my puppy Science Diet which I bought and it made my dog very sick. After doing some research, I checked the ingredients- all corn and fillers, horrible for my puppy. The next time we went in for shots and I told him my puppy had been having more accidents inside lately and he offered to give him a urine analysis or to put him on antibiotics without even testing him for anything. He also referred to my puppy as a boxer; I have a Boston terrier. \n\nExpensive and impersonal care, I would not recommend that anyone who wants the best care for their pet goes here."
"2","Love this place and let me tell you why, not only is it because of the food-- It's the customer service I get at this place!!! It had been a while since I have been in and I mean months, Emily remembered my name and what I order! She IS the  definition of what customer service is. Yes I understand its hard remembering names and what each person orders. But no matter what she always has a smile on her face and talks the same way to each person! She is going to go far in life no matter where or what she ends up doing! Thank you! And thank you Smashburger for making excellent choices when you hire people. \n\nNow on to the food-\nThe \""Smash Fries\"" have rosemary and olive oil on them... they are a great change from your normal everyday fries.\nThe Arizona Burger is really tasty, hot jalapenos piled high (I love this), habanero cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, purple onion, chipotle mayo, all on a chipotle bun.\n\nPlus++++ if you join their club they send amazing coupons to you!"
"2","Tried the fried egg burger. Delicious!  My wife and I are really starting to like this place. I would recommend giving it a shot!"
"1","NEEDS BETTER FOOD!!! Even Oakland upgraded... get with it Phoenix!!!"
"1","I went here one night with my friends and we heard advertisements about 2$ beers for guys and free drinks for girls with wristbands. We get there they physically hand us a flyer for all of the advertisements and still wouldn't give us the deal!!!! It was ridiculous, I literally had a flyer with the info in my hand! Then all the bar tenders were rude and also this place won't decide If it's a lame night club or a food/bar joint. Get real. First time and never again.the only thing good was Garrett sliger unfortunately he know longers works for the restuarnt"
"2","This was supposed to be my Holy Grail of food experiences. I had heard nothing but great things about \u00e9, I just had to find someone to go with that would be just as excited as I was to try it. Luckily, I found two people! We made our reservations 2 months in advance, knowing that there was 3 in our party, and they only seat 8 at a time, we thought it would be difficult since we had an odd number in our party. \n\nFinallly, the night came, I really couldn't contain my excitement for what was about to happen. We were led passed the bar area into another room. It was very quaint, dark and had a Spanish vibe to it. We were introduced to the culinary team. Cody, the sous chef was really good at explaining what dishes they were plating, and what we could expect when tasting the food. \n\nOut of the 20 tastings, a couple really stood out for me, #1 Lobster with Citrus & Jasmin, #2 Secreto Iberico Pork with Squid. My favorite dessert was the Pan con Chocolate. Two of my least favorites were the Foie Gras and the Fabes con Jam\u00f3n, both were so salty I didn't finish either one. \n\nWe all chose to do the wine pairing, which actually had beer and cocktails in the pairing. The alcohol was fantastic, although they were a little skimpy on the pours. Towards the end of the evening, we all felt they were rushing us a bit. There was a couple that showed up 20+ minutes late for dinner, so we thought maybe they were trying to make up for that time, but not cool to punish the rest of us. \n\nReason for my 4 star rating? Everything was good, but it definitely wasn't mind blowing. Dinner, wine pairing and tax and service charge came to $416 a person. It just didn't match up. I didn't think what I had was worth it. Like I said, I didn't leave mind blown. I def wouldn't recommend someone trying this as their first tasting."
"1","I'm so sorry- I really wanted to like this restaurant. This was my second time here. \n\nThe first time I went with my husband on a weeknight in October and had good drinks at the bar with very bad overcooked brownish-black potato chips and lackluster dip. But I decided to give them another try. \n\nI went into Bootleggers this afternoon for take-out. The kid at the take out register was very courteous and prompt, and my PBLT sandwich was delivered to me very quickly.\n\nBut then I got home. I live three blocks away.\n\nThe sandwich was so greasy, it had turned the grilled sourdough into a soggy mess. The pork belly was primarily made up of gristle- so much so, that I had to take my sandwich apart, cut all the gristle off of the pork belly (which took up a third of my plate when I was done), and then reconstruct the whole thing. I was unable to finish the entire sandwich, it was just that bad. I couldn't touch the potato chips that accompanied the sandwich. My husband tried a few and told me they were cooked well this time, but were devoid of any flavor- including salt.\n\nTo make matters worse, half an hour after eating the sandwich I got really sick. Not sure if it was all that grease that made me ill, but unless the owner or manager contacts me and guarantees that things have changed, I will not be going back."
"2","My husband and I have been seeing Dr. Lida Raoufi at American Family Dentistry for a few years now.  We used to drive to the NW Valley and wanted something closer to home.  We hit the jackpot finding Dr. Raoufi.  She is very professional and at the same time treats you like family.  She actually met me at her office on a Saturday for an emergency appointment.  That's unheard of, right???  Her staff is very friendly and knowledgeable as well!  I would highly recommend this dentist office.  We won't go anywhere else!!"
"1","Terrible customer service. I would not suggest anyone to come here and specifically not to make this your personal archery spot. The staff was completely rude, and were insulting my equipment by saying that\""PSE is crap equipment that is made in China and notorious for being shitty\"" give me a break! What does this 20 year old kid know. Their other employees were no help and all just stood around the store waiting for something to fall in their laps. The rumors were true, this place is overpriced and has terrible service. Although I live 5 minutes away, I will not take my business there again"
"2","I always choose to go to Steve 's if I want to try something new.  The staff have always helped both my wife and I to find either new wine or new beer for us to try. They are always very knowledgeable and provide great customer service.  They have a great wine selection."
"2","There's still no grocery in the Hill, so many Hill residents come here by bus to do their shopping. There are always lots of folks standing around in the parking lot socializing, which brings a smile to my face. \n\nThe store itself is small by Giant Eagle standards so selection is limited, but I can't complain about having a major grocery store right in the heart of the south side. \n\nAlso, you can park in their lot on Friday and Saturday nights while you're partying it up on Carson Street. Ignore the signs about towing unauthorized cars - that has never been enforced."
"2","Great brunch but no alcohol!!! In any case I love their midwestern cuts of pork and excellent breakfast flavors. Busy and popular."
"1","Am I the only one seeing all the flies at the deli counter?!\nI really don't like this location. I always see flies, I can't get used to the layout, There's no Kids Korner, check out conveyor belts are usually dirty. \nThe location at 67th and Beardsley is awesome! Super clean, never saw a fly. Number system at the deli counter, Starbucks, and a  Kids Korner with stellar employees."
"2","I recently changed vets and am now a client of Aloha Animal Hospital. You would think my pup believes we are going to the park and not to the vet. This vet is clean and comfortable, my pup LOVES it here and so do I. The staff is grade A and I could not be more pleased with my vet swap. I will never venture from Aloha!"
"2","There are a number of ways to get around The Strip: walking, taxi, monorail, and the Deuce. We've done them all but the favorite is the Deuce. \n\nWalking in the heat = blisters and heat exhaustion (not to mention lots of aggravation from the uncountable numbers of unsavory characters hawking their mothers, sisters, and girl-cousins who, if you believe the advertising... are more than willing to sell their affection). \n\nTaxi = convenient and comfortable, but expensive. \n\nMonorail = fun but not really all that close to the attractions on the strip (see \""Walking in the heat\"", above). \n\nDeuce = conveniently located right on the strip, lots of stops at all of the casino/hotel's... and affordable. Probably the best bargain for transportation in LV. Conveniently located stops that are clearly marked. Easy ticket buying (machines or on-board). Frequent schedule (varies but is between every 10 to 15 minutes). Drivers were courteous and helpful. Extremely clean and air conditioned. Sometimes the bus got crowed. Wait time at stops varies depending on number of riders exiting and entering. Might not be the best option if one is on a tight schedule, but when touring and in no rush it is comfortable and convenient!"
"2","Overall, I would say they are probably my favorite pizza chain around.  Their pizza, breadsticks and wings are all good and their price is fair.  I consider them to be a much better option over something like Domino's or Pizza Hut, but my favorite pizza in the valley is still Brother's Pizza.  I would definitely recommend checking them out if you are in the mood for pizza.  They are my go-to choice for pizza night!"
"1","Underwhelming. I had the banana cream pie & the whole ensemble was tasteless: crust, custard, & cream were all bland."
"1","TOURIST TRAP. I found this restaurant online and my hotel room magazine. It had a pretty good number of reviews and apparently the first bar and restaurant in Pittsburgh so I added it to my Pittsburgh dinner options list. It turns out very few people in Pittsburgh or at least in our office actually knew this restaurant. It's an old, tiny restaurant located in the beautiful Market Square. It's so old school they only take cash! The place is called  \""Original Oyster House\"" but ironically they don't serve raw oysters, let alone decent oysters! They only have these mediocre breaded oysters that you can have in your sandwich or by themselves. Everything else is average. There is nothing special about this place except for the fact that it was the \""first restaurant\"" in Da Burgh as supported by the front door sign \""historical landmark.\"" If you're looking for good oysters, raw or not, or simply a good restaurant for lunch or dinner, this is definitely NOT the place."
"1","Hostess is awkward and not friendly . \n\nWe ordered jalape\u00f1os on our burgers and instead of coming to tell us they were out, she just put jabaneros on it, and didn't say anything . A mouth full of fire later I ask wtf and she says oh yeah we substitute ........ Thanks for asking me .  Additionally, neither burger had the bacon we ordered on it. \n\nPotato salad was good but served with plastic spoons? \n\nGarlic fries were soggy .\n\nFood was acceptable: I would try again. Can't speak for the wings."
"1","Pros: -Fast delivery within Squirrel Hill -Moderate prices -Fairly diverse menu (does not have regular omissions typical to Squirrel Hill Pizza shops) -Several healthier options available on menu -Discounts and coupons galore -Online ordering is quick and easy Cons: -Drinks forgotten on order (very common for delivery orders) -Pizza is alright but not \""good' -Hoagies/subs are pretty bad (cheap bread, very little cheese & rubberized meat) -Deserts come frozen with the wax paper included -Fries very tasty but pretty soggy as well. -Foreign delivery driver may have difficulty with delivery instructions. While this is still a new establishment, given the amount of direct competition in the immediate area I would have expected better. The delivery time for my order was truly excellent but in their haste they disregarded my drink order. The Driver did return however within several minutes after being chased down, but the drink he returned with was still a variation on my drink order. I would say that the quality of the food is OK, not incredibly good but certainly not the worse pizza in town. Also, their personal pizza options and late night delivery option make it an attractive choice for delivery. On my order the desert arrived mostly frozen and still wrapped in it's original freezer wax paper. Also the fries were placed in Styrofoam which makes them soggy. There are 3 types of Pizza Shops in Squirrel Hill: -Specialty (Mineo's, Aiello's, Napoli's, Lucci's) -Big Chain (Vocelli, Domino's, Pizza Hut) -Budget (Amier, Rialto, Italian Village, Bellino) Pizza Bellino definitely belongs to the later category. For me, when judging a Squirrel Hill budget pizza shop, I always use Pizza Amier as a comparison standard (since their prices are the lowest in the neighborhood). Are they more or less expensive then Pizza Amier? Does their product taste better than Amier? Does the taste justify the cost? While they do offer a tasty product and some more diverse menu options than Amier, I do not feel that the taste justifies the cost in this instance. I would not recommend this Pizza Shop. However, if had no other option I wouldn't consider it out of the question either."
"1","I have been a \""regular\"" customer at this salon ever since it opened.  At first it was great!  Clean, relaxing, and welcoming.   After a few months without a manicure or pedicure I decide to treat myself to a manicure this past week.  I went in and a lady did a beautiful job on my gel manicure.  She paid attention to detail and didn't rush through the whole process.  I didn't have time to get a pedicure so I decided to come back the next day.  I only wish that I had her do my pedicure yesterday ... \n\nThe guy who did my pedicure had some sort of infection on his thumb.  I didn't notice it at first because he was using gloves but when it was time for the foot massage he took his gloves off, revealing it.  Tracy was doing someone else's nails right in front of me and clearly saw that he had some sort of sore or fungus on his nail.  It was completely black and it looked like something was growing out of it.    I was shocked that she didn't tell him to at least put his gloves back on.  The \""massage\"" that he gave me was hardly any massage at all.  He did the same motion over and over while concentrating on the tv.  Definitely not worth the $25.   The worst part is that he gave me an ingrown toe nail.  The whole right side of my nail is swollen and I just hope that I don't get an infection.  This was by far the worst pedicure that I have ever received. Even though I had a great gel manicure here, my last experience was so horrible that I will not be back."
"1","Yes...Domino's...you still Suck!! Stopped eating here for awhile because it was mostly just bread...then tried again after they \""claimed\"" they got better....still gross. Not impressed. Even my 6 year old wouldn't eat it, claiming it wasn't pizza! lol No more money lost to these guys.."
"2","I love this place for lunch and takeout for dinner. They always have very fresh food and great prices too. They work hard to fill your order promptly."
"2","What a beautiful place!  I had lunch here earlier this week and couldn't get over how spectacular this place is!  The food was good, the service was good, but the atmosphere was amazing!"
"2","Good drink specials and yummy appetizers, great music playing and very attractive servers - could not complain a bit!  They were really nice and accommodating to our large group.  Really nice day at this place.  Wish they had their misters installed though!"
"1","I find every sauce to be extremely salty...ruins almost every dish...but the bang bang shrimp is still a winner if you want an app and a beverage"
"1","way oversold, extremely long lines at every wine station, and many stations ran out of wine early in the night! Lake las vegas is a great location and the night was very beautiful. If i could do it over again, I would buy a few nice bottles of wine with the $60 i spent there and drink them with my date at lake las vegas, as there is no admission fee into the grounds. hope this helps"
"2","I am not much of the sports bar type. But after one experience here I was amazed. The service is great and they offer free pick up and drop off shuttle service within a five mile radius so no holding back necessary"
"2","Aside from customer service, I really do love Pet Club. They have a lot of natural foods and treats you may have a difficult time finding elsewhere. It is a little pricy but you get what you pay for. This is why I'm giving four stars instead of one. This is the first experience I've had trouble here, however I don't believe I'll be back at this location. \n\nSuper annoyed. This experience happened today 9/26 at around 2:15. I'd first like to mention that Logan was wonderful. Very friendly and helpful. Her manager however is a piece of work. Instead of admitting that he did not follow through with ordering a large bag of rabbit formula for me as they kindly do he not only threw his lovely employee, Logan under the bus (IN FRONT OF HER AND OTHERS), he then told me that there is a shortage on rabbits. Seriously? We all know how quickly they procreate. He then lead me to another brand of rabbit formula which was $30 more than the brand I was hoping for. Come on guy. He was hardly helpful and left Logan at the front calling another store for what I was looking for after telling her she's not on her game. The outcome? They had it and had no idea what he was talking about. \n\nCrazy unprofessional. I've worked for people like him and it's just not right. Own up to a silly mistake buddy... I wonder how many people you've undermined for your own well being."
"1","Hit up Surrender to see Calvin Harris LDW. Personally I think the venue was a bit too small for him. The inside section was over crowded and people were pushing. Just seemed way too much. \n\nThe space itself is average inside. The outdoor section is massive but you can't see the DJ if you're outside. Spent most of my time here vying for space and waiting for Harris. Not even enough space to dance on the dancefloor. Bummer. \n\nProbably won't go back, there are better venues."
"2","Came here with some friends after work to sit on the patio and share a few bottles of wine. This was a great place and excellent environment. Really broad range of wines to choose from and beers too. Hate the uncorking fee which seems a little exorbitant  on top of an already expensive bottle of wine...\n\nAlso at the sliders which were decent. I would come here again. Also a good place to bring babies and dogs on the patio which is what our group did."
"2","I'm looking to get more high end cookware for my cooking and came here just to have a look around and check out an exclusive Le Creuset item they have.\n\nWalked in and was quickly helped by a gentleman named Don who was extremely experienced. I asked him nearly every question I had and he spent a solid 20 minutes with us giving his opinion on what I should do. \n\nHe emphasized that he didn't work on commission and really wanted us to take our time in deciding which gave our experience a really nice, no pressure feel. \n\nEnded up getting the Le Creuset item I had been looking at and Don will be my go to guy when I can make my way over there in the future.\n\nOnly thing keeping this from being 5 stars is that their prices are ridiculous in my opinion and would only be able to justify buying something there if it was on sale... which is just what I did :)."
"1","Pushy annoying sales people. Overpirced Prices more than doubled in last year. Unprofessional employees rude, arrogant and disrespectful attitude. I would not buy from them if they were the only choice! HIgh turn over of staff says a lot about the company. Too many choices out there to waste your time with this racket."
"1","Decoration are very dusty.  Bathroom was not very clean.  After waiting for  1 hr for menudo, finally had enough of waiting.  Went to ask what was taking so long.  Informed that \""menudo was not ready\"".  Checked their health department grade and they got a \""c\"".  Will not be eating that menudo after all."
"1","I take my Yelp reviews very seriously.  To me, giving someone a one star yelp review means that they have done something so egregious, that someone either did or could have gotten hurt as a result.  Oh wait...that's exactly what happened.  I recently flew into Phoenix with my brother, his husband and their 11 month old baby for a family wedding.  We rented an SUV with a car seat.  Initially, my brother asked if the car seat could be installed for them, as they were unfamililar with this model, and they were told company policy dictates that they could not install the seat.  Fine.  No big deal.  We install the seat and off we go to our hotel to rest up for the drive to Sedona the next day.  \n\nMy brother's husband had a nagging feeling about the seat that just wouldn't go away.  Finally, he drove to the local police station to have it inspected and we were informed that Hertz had neglected to include the base of the carseat and that it was in fact, unsafe to hold a child.  A quick call to Hertz later and I KID YOU NOT, we were informed that it was not negligence on their part, it was negligence on our part for driving off with the car seat that they had provided.  Are you counting?  We have two strikes so far.  Massive error that could have led to death of child (that's gotta count for at least 10 strikes though...right) and then complete failure to take responsibility or attempt to fix the problem.  The bro in law located a nearby Hertz location, and they said we could come and pick up a new seat.  They gave us a new seat, they sure did.  Once again, I kid you not, this one was missing clips.  \n\nWe made our way back to the original Hertz location at the airport.  The staff were rude, and spent a great deal of time rolling their eyes at us when we asked them for assistance putting a strange car seat into a car that we'd never seen before.  I understand they can't actually install it for liability purposes, but I can't believe that no one else has struggled to install an unfamiliar seat in an unfamiliar car.  Regardless, we never once received an apology, just continued rude behavior and eye rolls.  I travel often and have never encountered such poor customer service and lack of concern for safety at a car rental agency.  You can be sure that Hertz will never receive mine, my family's or any of my friends' business again.  You can bet that they will never receive the business of random people who I run into on the street.  This is how infuriated I am by their negligience and egregious mishandling of the whole situation."
"1","Disgusting;  we just stopped in for an early dinner (4:00 p.m. Sunday evening) and went into the bar so we could watch the games.   There were two gals and a guy behind the bar, just chatting between themselves, and a few other patrons.   Every table that was empty was dirty, the bar had dirty dishes piled on it.   When we let it be known that we wanted to sit,and to please clean a table, we received so much attitude that the three of us walked out.   Obviously no management was on site, one of the gals (heavy, long curly hair) was extremely rude.   \n\nI'm so disappointed as I live in the same neighborhood but won't be going in there again.   If it's that filthy in front of customers, omg what does that back kitchen area look like? \n\nAll three of those employees should have been fired on the spot; as it was we ended up going to Tommy's and had a clean fabulous atmosphere in their bar area with much better food.   Thank you Tommy's.."
"2","This location is new and I absolutely love it!  Location, staff, clear cameras, clean play areas and furniture, they got it all.\n\nThere is also a free evaluation for your little one on the first visit.  Because this place is so new, there are not as many dogs as the Las Vegas location.  However, my little girl had a good time because the handlers there are so interactive.  I can see on the cam on my app, how much attention the handlers give her.  They pet her, give out commands, and she follows.  When we brought her home, she went to find her bed and plopped on it.\n\nAfter the evaluation, we quickly booked her overnight stay for St. Paddy's Weekend.  Because the little one play hard, I made sure the staff document my request.  The staff prints out the overnight campers card and jot down the amount of food to give Dolce, how many times a day, how she should rest for 20 minutes after 45 minutes of play.  They are very detailed and accepted my little girl with kindness.\n\nWhen Earl and I went to go pick her up, we even requested for a tour of the camp.  There is a room for tiny dogs, a play area for small dogs, another for medium dogs, and a bigger play area for large dogs.  Those areas also have another part that dogs are allowed to go outside for some VITA D.\n\nWe definitely feel not so guilty for leaving our baby here.  She is well taken care of."
"2","Mexican food at its best. The restaurant atmosphere is family friendly. Great place to dine before or after badger games. The staff is friendly and attentive. However, when the restaurant is full of badger faithfull, you can bet you will need to be patient. It gets loud with excited fans ready  to munch on some delicious mexican food. I love the enchilada verdes with a side of mole. All the burritos re great and they cater to vegetarians and vegans alike."
"1","It took almost an hour for them to make 2 burgers. Worst service I've had in a long time!"
"1","Decided to shop at Target rather than Walmart, to find a better selection of hair clippers for my husband. Purchased a set, got hone and opened the box to find that they had been previously owned and well USED by someone else (complete with hair and even some dandruff). I called the store immediately and asked for the manager. I was then asked by a store employee to leave a message and I said no, I needed to speak with the store manager as soon as possible...about a complaint! The manager I spoke with could care less and didn't even apologise. Highly disappointed with this stores quality control, apparently someone in the Returns Department was slacking off. Needless to say the item was returned and I wouldn't be surprised if its waiting on the shelf for some other poor individual to purchase."
