\section{\textbf{Course Description}}

This course introduces fundamental methods for reasoning quantitatively about data. It covers foundational
concepts in discrete mathematics, probability, and predictive modeling. It also emphasizes complementary computational skills to apply these concepts to real problems. The course requires demonstrated proficiency with introductory computer programming. All coding assignments will be in Python 3.

The following topics will be covered:

\begin{itemize}
\item Mathematical types and corresponding data structures
\item Counting and combinatorics (combinations and permutations)
\item Foundational concepts in probability (independence, marginalization, expected value)
\item Probability distributions (discrete and continuous)
\item Conditional probability (with applications in language modeling and music generation)
\item Implementing and working with probability concepts in code (distributions, pseudorandom sampling)
\end{itemize}

By the end of this semester you will be able to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Understand different types of mathematical objects, and how to implement those objects in code
\item Reason about problems involving uncertainty
\item Randomly generate data and run simulations in code
\end{itemize}

\section{\textbf{Cumulative Instruction}}

This course covers foundational mathematical concepts that you will use again and again in working with data. In order to help you master the material, the course will be taught \textit{cumulatively}. That means that quizzes, lectures and homeworks will revisit material from earlier in the semester, over and over again. 

Because the course is \textit{cumulative}, as you study for quizzes and tests, you'll want to remind yourself of everything we've covered in the course so far, as you will see questions from material across the semester. Additionally, if you don't understand a concept, it will be very important to come to office hours to get help. You will very likely see the concept on future assignments and assessments, not to mention in your future life as an information scientist!

\section{\textbf{Course Design}}
Class will meet three times per week (\mymeetingdays)\space from \mymeetingtimes\space on Zoom. \textbf{Attendance is required during class time.} 

This course will largely follow a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom}{``flipped classroom''}  model. You will watch pre-recorded lectures before class. During class, we will discuss and practice what you have learned from pre-recorded lectures. \textbf{You will be expected to have watched the lectures before starting class}. During class, there will be regular quizzes to assess what you have learned from pre-recorded videos. 

In order to fully participate remotely, students will need access to a personal computer with a web camera, a reliable high-speed internet connection, and a minimally disruptive background environment. Please email the instructor immediately if you expect any issues with remote participation.

\section{\textbf{Quizzes and attendance}}

This class will include many quizzes. The quizzes are important! They count for almost as much as homework towards your final grade. Quizzes might come at the start of class, and test material from the pre-recorded lecture. Or they might come at the end of class, and assess material from in-class exercises. Because everyone sometimes has a bad day or needs more time to master a new concept, the instructor will automatically drop the lowest five quiz scores from your final grade. You will take quizzes during class, so quizzes will count as your attendance score. Because things sometimes come up, you will be able to miss three quizzes across the semester without any attendance penalty. 

\section{\textbf{Textbook and software }}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Textbook}: \href{https://www.abehandler.com/resources/openintro-statistics.pdf}{OpenIntro} Statistics (free)
\item \textbf{Software}: Assignments will use \href{https://www.python.org/}{Python 3} in \href{https://jupyter.org/}{Jupyter notebooks}
\end{itemize}

\section{\textbf{Prerequisites}}

Requires prerequisite course of INFO 1201 or CSCI 1200 or CSCI 1300 or LING 1200 or ATLS 1300 (all minimum grade C-). If you have questions, please email the instructor.

\section{\textbf{Late work policy}}
The instructor understands that students are busy with many obligations. Therefore, across the whole semester, you will be allotted a total of five free late days to turn in assignments. If you turn in an assignment within 24 hours after the deadline you will be deducted 1 late day. If you turn in an assignment within 48 hours after the deadline you will be deducted 2 late days, and so on. If you have used five or fewer late days so far during the semester (including the most recent assignment) you will not be penalized for late work. However, after you have used up your late days, late homework will not count for credit except in special circumstances.

\section{\textbf{Grading}}

Final grades are calculated according to the following distribution:
\begin{itemize}
\item 5\% Attendance (based on in-class quizzes)
\item 25\% Quizzes (in class and/or online)
\item 30\% Homework
\item 20\% Midterm Exam
\item 20\% Final Exam
\end{itemize}

Letter grades will follow a typical scoring distribution (A if >= 93\%, A- if >= 90\%, B+ if >=
87\%, B if >= 83\%, B- if >= 80\%, C+ if >= 77\%, and so on). Do not expect most grades to be
curved, though exam grades may be curved if needed.

% \subsection{Requirements}
% Students' regular and sustained participation in all class activities as well as punctual and thorough completion of assignments are essential. If you need to be excused from attending a class session or need an extension to an assignment, please \href{mailto:brian.keegan@colorado.edu}{email instructor} at least 24 hours in advance.

\section{\textbf{Course Website and Materials}}
There is no textbook required for class, but there will be required readings, tutorials, and other material, which will be made available through Canvas:
\vspace{-8pt}
    \begin{center}
    \Large{\textbf{Canvas}: \href{\mycanvasurl}{\mycanvasurl}}\\
    \Large{\textbf{Zoom}: \href{\myzoomurl}{\myzoomurl}}
    \end{center}
\vspace{-8pt}
Once the semester begins, this PDF version of the syllabus will be revised infrequently and any revised requirements will be posted as announcements and updated course schedule to Canvas. The instructors reserve the right to make changes to the course's schedule, evaluation criteria, policies, \textit{etc.} through announcements in class and on Canvas, so please check Canvas regularly. If you have questions, please email the instructor.


\section{\textbf{Computing Requirements}}
Students will need to use statistical computing software as well as teleconferencing software to participate in class. \href{http://jupyter.org/}{Jupyter notebooks} written in Python 3 will be used for all in-class examples and assignments. The \href{https://www.continuum.io/why-anaconda}{Anaconda distribution} of Python 3.5 (or above) is \textit{strongly} recommended to provide all of these programs and other libraries. Lectures will include exercises and presentations with the expectation that students participate with their own computers. If students do not have access to a computer to use for computing or Zoom, they should immediately email the instructor. Instructional support will only be provided for Anaconda and Python. Students who require technical assistance should email the instructors with the code and data they are working with, a summary of their debugging efforts to date, and attend an instructor's office hours.


\section{Course Policies}

% \subsection{Professional Expectations}
% In addition to the expectations outlined in the \href{https://www.colorado.edu/creed/}{Colorado Creed}, we expect students to conduct themselves in a professional manner in their interactions

\subsection{In-Class Confidentiality}
The success of this class depends on students feeling comfortable sharing questions, ideas, concerns, and confusions about assignments, work-in-progress, and their personal experiences. Students may read, comment, and run on classmates' writing, code, and other class-related content for the sole purpose of use within this class. However, students may not use, run, copy, perform, display, distribute, modify, translate, or create derivative works of another student's work outside of this class without that student's expressed written consent or formal license. Furthermore, students may not create any audio, video, or other records during class time without the instructor's permission nor may students publicly share comments made in class attributable to another person's identity without that person's permission.

% \subsection{Critical Response Process}
% The class will make regular use of Liz Lerman's ``\href{https://lizlerman.com/critical-response-process/}{Critical Response Process}'' for the Weekly Presentations and the Final Project. The details of this process will be covered in more detail in Week 1, but students will rotate through the roles of ``artist'' and ``responder'' regularly. Students are expected to participate in good faith when sharing statements of meaning, questions, neutral questions, and permissioned opinions.

\subsection{Instructor Interaction}
The instructor will check e-mail between 8:00 and 18:00 on non-holiday business days and try to respond to emails within 24 hours. E-mailing the instructor or coming to (remote) office hours are the best ways to get help and feedback outside of lecture.

\subsection{Accommodations for Disabilities}
We are committed to providing everyone the support and services needed to participate in this course. If you qualify for accommodations because of a disability, please submit your accommodation letter from Disability Services to the instructor in a timely manner so that your needs can be addressed. Disability Services determines accommodations based on documented disabilities in the academic environment. Information on requesting accommodations is located on the \href{Disability Services website}{www.colorado.edu/disabilityservices/students}. Contact Disability Services at 303-492-8671 or \href{mailto:dsinfo@colorado.edu}{dsinfo@colorado.edu} for further assistance. If you have a temporary medical condition or injury, see Temporary Medical Conditions under the Students tab on the Disability Services website and discuss your needs with the instructors.

\subsection{Religious Observance}
Campus policy regarding \href{http://www.colorado.edu/policies/observance-religious-holidays-and-absences-classes-andor-exams}{religious observances} requires that faculty make every effort to deal reasonably and fairly with all students who, because of religious obligations, have conflicts with scheduled exams, assignments or required assignments/attendance. If this applies to you, please e-mail the instructor as soon as possible to make the appropriate accommodations.

\subsection{Classroom Behavior}
Students and instructors each have responsibility for maintaining an appropriate learning environment. Those who fail to adhere to such behavioral standards may be subject to discipline. Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with differences of race, color, culture, religion, creed, politics, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity and gender expression, age, ability, and nationality. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student's legal name. The instructor will honor your request to address you by an alternate name or gender pronoun. Please advise the instructor of this preference early in the semester in order to make appropriate changes. For more information, see the policies on \href{http://www.colorado.edu/policies/student-classroom-and-course-related-behavior}{class behavior} and the \href{http://www.colorado.edu/osc/#student_code}{student code}.

\subsection{Harassment and Discrimination}
The University of Colorado Boulder (CU Boulder) is committed to maintaining a positive learning, working, and living environment. CU Boulder will not tolerate acts of sexual misconduct, discrimination, harassment or related retaliation against or by any employee or student. CU's \href{http://www.colorado.edu/policies/discrimination-and-harassment-policy-and-procedures}{Sexual Misconduct Policy} prohibits sexual assault, sexual exploitation, sexual harassment, intimate partner abuse (dating or domestic violence), stalking or related retaliation. CU Boulder's \href{http://www.colorado.edu/policies/discrimination-and-harassment-policy-and-procedures}{Discrimination and Harassment Policy} prohibits discrimination, harassment or related retaliation based on race, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, age, disability, creed, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, veteran status, political affiliation or political philosophy. Individuals who believe they have been subject to misconduct under either policy should contact the Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance (OIEC) at 303-492-2127. Information about the OIEC, the above referenced policies, and the campus resources available to assist individuals regarding sexual misconduct, discrimination, harassment or related retaliation can be found at the \href{http://www.colorado.edu/institutionalequity/}{OIEC website}.

\subsection{Honor Code}
All students enrolled in a University of Colorado Boulder course are responsible for knowing and adhering to the \href{http://www.colorado.edu/policies/academic-integrity-policy}{academic integrity policy} of the institution. Violations of the policy may include: plagiarism, cheating, fabrication, lying, bribery, threat, unauthorized access to academic materials, clicker fraud, resubmission, and aiding academic dishonesty. All incidents of academic misconduct will be reported to the Honor Code Council (\href{mailto:honor@colorado.edu}{honor@colorado.edu}; 303-735-2273). Students who are found responsible for violating the academic integrity policy will be subject to nonacademic sanctions from the Honor Code Council as well as academic sanctions from the faculty member. Additional information can be found at \href{http://honorcode.colorado.edu}{honorcode.colorado.edu}. 

\subsection{Illness}
Should a student contract any illness that requires mandatory sequestration, intensive medical treatment, or extended convalescence and disrupts their ability to participate in class and complete assignments, the instructors will try to accommodate their condition without penalty with extensions and incompletes. This also applies if the student has a family member whose diagnosis, treatment, and recovery will affect their ability to participate. Students should notify the instructors as soon as possible of events that will impact their engagement with the class so that we can triage and develop an accommodation plan rather than scrambling at the end of the semester.
