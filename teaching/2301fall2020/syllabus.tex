TODO: cumulative instruction, quizzes, expectations about that, modules, all of Burlinsons stuff


\section{\textbf{Course Description}}

Introduces methods for quantifying and analyzing different types of data, covering foundational
concepts in discrete mathematics, probability, and predictive modeling, along with complementary computational skills to apply these concepts to real problems. Covers counting and combinatorics, logic, set theory, introductory probability, common probability distributions, regression,
and model validation. Requires demonstrated proficiency with introductory computer programming.

The following topics will be covered

\begin{itemize}
\item Data types and corresponding data structures in Python
\item Operations on data structures (sets and vectors)
\item Counting and combinatorics (combinations and permutations)
\item Probability concepts (independence, marginalization, expected value)
\item Probability distributions (discrete and continuous)
\item Conditional probability (language modeling and music generation as applications)
\item Probability in Python (distributions, pseudorandom sampling)
\end{itemize}


\section{\textbf{Cumulative Instruction}}

This course covers foundational mathematical concepts that you will use again and again in working with data. In order to help you master the material, the course will be taught \textit{cumulatively}. That means that quizzes, lectures and homeworks will revisit material from earlier in the semester, over and over again. 

Because the course is \textit{cumulative}, as you study for quizzes and tests, you'll want to remind yourself of everything we've covered in the course so far, as you will see questions from material across the semester. Additionally, if you don't understand a concept, it will be very important to come to office hours to get help. You will very likely see the concept on future assignments and assessments, not to mention in your future life as an information scientist!

\section{Textbook and software }

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Textbook}: \href{https://www.abehandler.com/resources/openintro-statistics.pdf}{OpenIntro} Statistics (free)
\item \textbf{Software}: Assignments will use \href{https://www.python.org/}{Python 3} in \href{https://jupyter.org/}{Jupyter notebooks}
\end{itemize}


\section{Learning Goals}

By the end of this semester you will be able to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Understand the different types of mathematical objects, and how to implement those objects in code
\item Learn how to reason under uncertainty
\item Solve problems involving probabilistic data
\item Randomly generate data 
\item Run simulations in code
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Course Design}
Class will meet three times per week (\mymeetingdays)\space from \mymeetingtimes\space on Zoom. As we detail below, we will be employing a ``flipped classroom'' in which students watch pre-recorded lectures before class and class time prioritizes discussions, case studies, and activities. Student performance will be evaluated through a combination of Module Assignments, Module Quizzes, Participation, and a Final Project. 

The class is split up into seven two-week modules TODO TODO


\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0pt,leftmargin=1em]
    
    \item \textbf{Flipped classroom}. We will employ a ``\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom}{flipped classroom}'' strategy in which pre-recorded lectures are posted on Canvas and in-class time prioritizes discussions and ``hands-on-keyboard'' activities. \textit{Attendance is required.} Students will be expected to have watched the lectures before starting class, attendance will be taken for each class, and there will be regular quizzes to assess student comprehension.
    
    % \item \textbf{Reduced density}. Our classroom has capacity for 52 students but the need to limit attendance within confined spaces will mean this capacity is capped closer to 15 students. We will discuss options in the first week for whether to even hold in-person classes and who can attend in-person classes. 
    
    \item \textbf{Synchronous instruction}. 
    % The need to accommodate students with health conditions, the difficulties with scheduling classrooms large enough to fit 50 students while maintaining safe distancing, and the possibility of falling back to a fully remote delivery option all mean that 
    We will use a ``synchronous remote'' instructional model: students will attend on Zoom at the scheduled time. \textit{Attendance is required.} In order to fully participate remotely, students will need access to a personal computer with a web camera, a reliable high-speed internet connection, and a minimally disruptive background environment. We will discuss, debug, and develop practices about how best to run this instructional model and are open to feedback and iteration throughout the term. %We recognize this instructional model will complicate discussions and activities. % In the event that health of the general public, CU community, or instructors requires a fully \href{https://www.colorado.edu/roadmap/modes-operation}{remote mode of operation}, we will make an announcement via Canvas and the entire class will meet on Zoom and no instruction will take place on campus. 
  
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Prerequisites}

Requires prerequisite course of INFO 1201 or CSCI 1200 or CSCI 1300 or LING 1200 or ATLS 1300 (all minimum grade C-). If you have questions, please email the instructor.

\section{Late work policy}
The instructor understands that students are busy with many obligations. Therefore, across the whole semester, you will be allotted a total of five free late days to turn in assignments. If you turn in your assignment within 24 hours after the deadline you will be deducted 1 late day, if you turn in in your assignment within 48 hours after the deadline you will be deducted 2 late days, and so on. 

If you have used five or fewer late days so far during the semester (including the most recent assignment) you will not be penalized for late work. However, after you have used up your late days, late homework will not count for credit except in special circumstances.

\section{Grading}

Final grades are calculated according to the following distribution:
\begin{itemize}
\item 5\% Attendance
\item 10\% Quizzes (in class and/or online)
\item 40\% Homework
\item 20\% Midterm Exam
\item 25\% Final Exam
\end{itemize}

Letter grades will follow a typical scoring distribution (A if >= 93\%, A- if >= 90\%, B+ if >=
87\%, B if >= 83\%, B- if >= 80\%, C+ if >= 77\%, and so on). Do not expect most grades to be
curved, though exam grades may be curved if needed.

% \subsection{Requirements}
% Students' regular and sustained participation in all class activities as well as punctual and thorough completion of assignments are essential. If you need to be excused from attending a class session or need an extension to an assignment, please \href{mailto:brian.keegan@colorado.edu}{email instructor} at least 24 hours in advance.

% \clearpage
\subsection{Course Website and Materials}
There is no textbook required for class, but there will be required readings, tutorials, and other material, which will be made available through Canvas:
\vspace{-8pt}
    \begin{center}
    \Large{\textbf{Canvas}: \href{\mycanvasurl}{\mycanvasurl}}\\
    \Large{\textbf{Zoom}: \href{\myzoomurl}{\myzoomurl}}
    \end{center}
\vspace{-8pt}
Once the semester begins, this PDF version of the syllabus will be revised infrequently and any revised requirements will be posted as announcements and updated course schedule to Canvas. The instructors reserve the right to make changes to the course's schedule, evaluation criteria, policies, \textit{etc.} through announcements in class and on Canvas, so please check Canvas regularly. If you have questions, please email \href{mailto:\instructorAemail}{Dr. \instructorAlastname}.

% The class will make extensive use of the \href{https://www.medium.com}{Medium} blogging platform. Instruction on how to create accounts, read, write, and post to the \href{https://medium.com/information-expositions}{class publication} will be covered in the first week of class. There is extensive documentation in the \href{https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us}{Medium Help Center} as well as multiple tutorials. Students will write their Module Assignments on Medium and submit links via Canvas with the expectation that their writing will be read by the general public. If students are unable or do not want to use the Medium platform, they should \href{mailto:brian.keegan@colorado.edu}{email the instructor} \textbf{immediately} to work out an alternative arrangement before Wednesday, September 4.

\subsection{Computing Requirements}
Students will need to use statistical computing software as well as teleconferencing software to participate in class. \href{http://jupyter.org/}{Jupyter notebooks} written in Python 3 will be used for all in-class examples and assignments. The \href{https://www.continuum.io/why-anaconda}{Anaconda distribution} of Python 3.5 (or above) is \textit{strongly} recommended to provide all of these programs and other libraries. Lectures will include exercises and presentations with the expectation that students participate with their own computers. If students do not have access to a computer to use for computing or Zoom, they should immediately email the instructor. Students are welcome to use an alternative \textit{programmatic} (\textit{not} Excel or Tableau) data analysis environment like R, Matlab, Julia, \textit{etc.}, but instructional support will only be provided for Anaconda and Python. Students who require technical assistance should email the instructors with the code and data they are working with, a summary of their debugging efforts to date, and attend an instructor's office hours.


\section{Course Policies}

% \subsection{Professional Expectations}
% In addition to the expectations outlined in the \href{https://www.colorado.edu/creed/}{Colorado Creed}, we expect students to conduct themselves in a professional manner in their interactions

\subsection{In-Class Confidentiality}
The success of this class depends on students feeling comfortable sharing questions, ideas, concerns, and confusions about assignments, work-in-progress, and their personal experiences. Students may read, comment, and run on classmates' writing, code, and other class-related content for the sole purpose of use within this class. However, students may not use, run, copy, perform, display, distribute, modify, translate, or create derivative works of another student's work outside of this class without that student's expressed written consent or formal license. Furthermore, students may not create any audio, video, or other records during class time without the instructor's permission nor may students publicly share comments made in class attributable to another person's identity without that person's permission.

% \subsection{Critical Response Process}
% The class will make regular use of Liz Lerman's ``\href{https://lizlerman.com/critical-response-process/}{Critical Response Process}'' for the Weekly Presentations and the Final Project. The details of this process will be covered in more detail in Week 1, but students will rotate through the roles of ``artist'' and ``responder'' regularly. Students are expected to participate in good faith when sharing statements of meaning, questions, neutral questions, and permissioned opinions.

\subsection{Instructor Interaction}
The instructor will check e-mail between 8:00 and 18:00 on non-holiday business days and try to respond to emails within 24 hours. They welcome online or offline interactions outside of class, however these are not appropriate spaces for discussing class matters. E-mailing the instructor or coming to (remote) office hours are the best ways to get help and feedback outside of lecture.

\subsection{Accommodations for Disabilities}
We are committed to providing everyone the support and services needed to participate in this course. If you qualify for accommodations because of a disability, please submit your accommodation letter from Disability Services to the instructor in a timely manner so that your needs can be addressed. Disability Services determines accommodations based on documented disabilities in the academic environment. Information on requesting accommodations is located on the \href{Disability Services website}{www.colorado.edu/disabilityservices/students}. Contact Disability Services at 303-492-8671 or \href{mailto:dsinfo@colorado.edu}{dsinfo@colorado.edu} for further assistance. If you have a temporary medical condition or injury, see Temporary Medical Conditions under the Students tab on the Disability Services website and discuss your needs with the instructors.

\subsection{Religious Observance}
Campus policy regarding \href{http://www.colorado.edu/policies/observance-religious-holidays-and-absences-classes-andor-exams}{religious observances} requires that faculty make every effort to deal reasonably and fairly with all students who, because of religious obligations, have conflicts with scheduled exams, assignments or required assignments/attendance. If this applies to you, please e-mail \href{\instructorAemail}{Dr. Handler} as soon as possible to make the appropriate accommodations.

\subsection{Classroom Behavior}
Students and instructors each have responsibility for maintaining an appropriate learning environment. Those who fail to adhere to such behavioral standards may be subject to discipline. Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with differences of race, color, culture, religion, creed, politics, veteran’s status, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity and gender expression, age, ability, and nationality. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student's legal name. The instructor will honor your request to address you by an alternate name or gender pronoun. Please advise the instructors of this preference early in the semester so that we may make appropriate changes. For more information, see the policies on \href{http://www.colorado.edu/policies/student-classroom-and-course-related-behavior}{class behavior} and the \href{http://www.colorado.edu/osc/#student_code}{student code}.

\subsection{Harassment and Discrimination}
The University of Colorado Boulder (CU Boulder) is committed to maintaining a positive learning, working, and living environment. CU Boulder will not tolerate acts of sexual misconduct, discrimination, harassment or related retaliation against or by any employee or student. CU's \href{http://www.colorado.edu/policies/discrimination-and-harassment-policy-and-procedures}{Sexual Misconduct Policy} prohibits sexual assault, sexual exploitation, sexual harassment, intimate partner abuse (dating or domestic violence), stalking or related retaliation. CU Boulder's \href{http://www.colorado.edu/policies/discrimination-and-harassment-policy-and-procedures}{Discrimination and Harassment Policy} prohibits discrimination, harassment or related retaliation based on race, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, age, disability, creed, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, veteran status, political affiliation or political philosophy. Individuals who believe they have been subject to misconduct under either policy should contact the Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance (OIEC) at 303-492-2127. Information about the OIEC, the above referenced policies, and the campus resources available to assist individuals regarding sexual misconduct, discrimination, harassment or related retaliation can be found at the \href{http://www.colorado.edu/institutionalequity/}{OIEC website}.

\subsection{Honor Code}
All students enrolled in a University of Colorado Boulder course are responsible for knowing and adhering to the \href{http://www.colorado.edu/policies/academic-integrity-policy}{academic integrity policy} of the institution. Violations of the policy may include: plagiarism, cheating, fabrication, lying, bribery, threat, unauthorized access to academic materials, clicker fraud, resubmission, and aiding academic dishonesty. All incidents of academic misconduct will be reported to the Honor Code Council (\href{mailto:honor@colorado.edu}{honor@colorado.edu}; 303-735-2273). Students who are found responsible for violating the academic integrity policy will be subject to nonacademic sanctions from the Honor Code Council as well as academic sanctions from the faculty member. Additional information can be found at \href{http://honorcode.colorado.edu}{honorcode.colorado.edu}. 

\subsection{Illness}
Should a student contract any illness that requires mandatory sequestration, intensive medical treatment, or extended convalescence and disrupts their ability to participate in class and complete assignments, the instructors will try to accommodate their condition without penalty with extensions and incompletes. This also applies if the student has a family member whose diagnosis, treatment, and recovery will affect their ability to participate. \textit{Please do not ghost us}: students should notify the instructors as soon as possible of events that will impact their engagement with the class so that we can triage and develop an accommodation plan rather than scrambling at the end of the semester.
