In 2301, we will use them to get feedback on our code as we work on the notebooks. Down the line, I will also use them to autograde your submissions. But first let's understand how they work. Open up `settests.py` and `setops.py`. Then run `settests.py` with `$pytest settests.py` in your terminal. What happens? Why do you think that is? You will have to install [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/assert.html) to complete this question.\n",
