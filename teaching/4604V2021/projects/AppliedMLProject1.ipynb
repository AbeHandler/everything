    "You will be graded based on:\n",
    "1. __Technical completeness__. _(12 points)_ \n",

    "Did you meet the technical requirements for the project? For instance, did you describe hyperparameter tuning and include plots, where necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __Creativity, imagination and ambition__. _(3 points)_ \n",
    "\n",
    "Did you form an interesting, creative and ambitious question, and explain why it is important to answer that question?\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note: downloading a ready-made dataset you find online (e.g. on Kaggle) and answering a question that is already defined for you will make it hard to get full points for creativity, imagination and ambition. (Unless you do something else interesting and ambitious, e.g. analyze attributes of a specific model very closely.) To get full points for creativity/imagination/ambition you will need to think a little a bit more. The bar will be higher for 5604 students._\n",

    "3. __Presentation__. _(5 points)_ \n",
    "\n",
    "Did you do a good job presenting your results? Would your notebook make sense to a person who was not familiar with your project? You should take time to write clearly, simplify your code and explain what you are doing in your notebook. At minimum:\n",

    "- Make sure your plots are well-labeled and appropriately scaled, delete code that does not work correctly, and be sure to mix code and text so that readers can easily understand your work. \n",
    "- Check out [this](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2015/07/23/learning-seattles-work-habits-from-bicycle-counts/) blog post for a nice example of how to present a data analysis clearly.\n",

Your question can be narrow (e.g. can we predict a dog's height from its weight) or broad (e.g. what features are important or unimportant in predicting the price of a house). Briefly describe why your question is important and how you plan to answer. Be sure to explain what is imaginative, creative or ambitious about your planned work! For instance, will you spend a lot of time defining new features, will you be working with hard-to-get data, will your work inform a major theoretical debate?

There are many, many places to find interesting datasets online related to many topics like music, politics, sports, transportation, etc. Data gathering is one way to make your project more creative, but you are not necessarily expected to take on a major data gathering effort.
