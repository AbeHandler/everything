\section{Sets}

A \textbf{set} is an unordered collection of items, without duplicates. 

People follow a number of conventions when talking about sets.

\begin{itemize}
    \item The items in a set are often called ``elements''
    \item We use capital letters to name sets
    \item We show the elements in a set using curly brackets
    \item A set can include any kind of element (e.g.\ strings, or kinds of apple)
\end{itemize}

\begin{exmp}
We can write the integers between 0 and 3 (including 0 and 3) as $A$ = $\{0,1,2,3\}$
\end{exmp}

\begin{exmp}
Because sets do not have order, if $ B= \{0,1\}$ and $C=\{1,0\}$, then $C=B$.
\end{exmp}

\begin{exmp}
A set of strings, $ P= \{ \text{\say{Denver},\say{Boulder},\say{Broomfield}} \}$
\end{exmp}

\begin{itemize}
    \item If $a$ is an element in $X$ then, we use the notation $a \in X$ 
    \item If $a \in X$ then we say that ``$a$ is in $X$''
    \item We write this: \verb|$a \in X$|
    \item If $a \notin X$ then we say that ``$a$ is not in $X$''
    \item We write this: \verb|$a \notin X$|
\end{itemize}

\begin{exmp}
Let $ C= \{1, 2\}$. Then $1 \in C$ and $6 \notin C$
\end{exmp}


\subsection{Subsets}

If all elements of $A$ are elements of $B$ then we say that $A$ is a subset of $B$.  We use the notation $ A \subset B$ (written \verb|$ A  \subset B $|) to indicate that $A$ is a subset of $B$.

\begin{exmp}\label{e:subset}
Let $ A= \{2, 1\}$ and $B = \{1,2,5\}$. Then $A \subset B$
\end{exmp}

In this class, when we use $ A \subset B$ we will assume that some elements of $B$ are not elements of $A$. So $A$ is a ``proper subset'' of $B$. For instance, in Example \ref{e:subset}, $A \subset B$ because $5 \in B$ and $5 \notin A$. If we want to allow for the possibility that $A=B$, we can use the notation $A \subseteq B$ (written \verb|$ A \subseteq B $|). 

\begin{exmp}
Let $ A= \{1, 2,3 \}$ and $B = \{1,2,3\}$. Then $A \subseteq B$ but not $A \subset B$
\end{exmp}

\begin{exmp}
Let $ A= \{1, 3 \}$ and $B = \{1,2,3\}$. Then $A \subseteq B$ and $A \subset B$
\end{exmp}

\subsection{Intersections, unions and complements}

\begin{itemize}

\item We use the notation $A \cap B$ (written \verb|$ A  \cap B $|) to indicate all of the elements that are in \textit{both} $A$ and $B$. This is called the \textit{intersection} of $A$ and $B$

\item We use the notation $A \cup B$ (written \verb|$ A  \cup B $|) to indicate all of the elements that are in $A$ or $B$. This is called the \textit{union} of $A$ and $B$.

\item To understand intersections and unions it is often helpful to draw venn diagrams. 

\end{itemize}

\begin{exmp}
Let $ A= \{1, 2, 3\}$ and $B = \{2,3,7\}$. Then $A \cap B$ = $\{2, 3\}$ and $A \cup B$ = $\{1,2, 3, 7\}$
\end{exmp}

\begin{itemize}
\item The complement of a set $A$ is the set of all elements that are not in $A$
\item The complement of a set requires defining $U$, the universal set of all possible elements
\item We write the complement of $A$ as $\overline{A}$ (written \verb|$ \overline{A} $| 
\item We can also write the complement as $A^c$  (written \verb|$ A^c $|)
\end{itemize}

\begin{exmp}
Let $ U= \{1, 2, 3\}$ and $A = \{2\}$. Then $\overline{A}$ = $\{1, 3\}$ 
\end{exmp}

\subsection{Cardinality}

The number of items in a set is called the \textit{cardinality} of the set. We use the notation $\vert F \vert$ (written \verb|$ \vert F \vert $|) to indicate the cardinality of a set.

\begin{exmp}
Let $ F = \{1, -2, 42 \}$, then $\vert F \vert$ = 3
\end{exmp}

\section{Functions}

\begin{itemize}
\item A function maps elements from one set to another. 
\item The first set is called the domain.
\item The second set is called the range. 
\item A function maps each element from the domain to exactly one element in the range.
\item We write this $f: A \rightarrow B$ where $f$ is a function mapping elements of $A$ to $B$ (written \verb|$f: A \rightarrow B $|) 
\end{itemize}

\begin{exmp}
Let $A$ be a set $\{0,1,2,3\}$ and let $f$ be a function mapping every element of $A$ to -19. The domain of $f$ is $A$ and the range is $\{-19\}$
\end{exmp}

\begin{exmp}
Let $A$ be the set of all integers and let $B$ be the set of all integers. The \texttt{addOne} function maps each element in $A$ to the element in $B$ that is exactly one greater. For instance, the \texttt{addOne} function maps 4 to 5.
\end{exmp}

\section{Vectors}

\begin{itemize}
\item A vector is a list of numbers. 
\item Each number in the vector is called a ``component'' and represents a dimension of the vector. 
\item We denote vectors with bold, lower-case letters and triangle brackets, such as $ \mathbf{x}=<1,2> $ (written \verb|$  \mathbf{x}=<1,2> $|)
\item We can use subscripts to refer to components of a vector. If $\mathbf{x}=<6,9>$ then $\mathbf{x}_1$ = 6 (assuming indexing starting at one)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Vector addition}

Vector addition is an operation which takes two input vectors and returns one output vector. If  $\mathbf{x}=<x_1, x_2 ... x_n>$ and $\mathbf{y}=<y_1, y_2 ... y_n>$  then  $\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{y}=<x_1 + y_1, x_2 + y_2 ... x_n + y_n>$.

\begin{exmp}
$\mathbf{x}=<3,4>$ and $\mathbf{y}=<-1,2>$  then  $\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{y}=<2,6>$
\end{exmp}

\subsection{Summation notation}

Summation notation is important for vector operations, and in many other areas of math. 

\begin{itemize}
\item To indicate the sum of a sequence of items, we write $\Sigma_{i=0}^Nx_i$ where $x_i$ is the $i$th item in a sequence. 
\item You can read this as summing over a sequence of items, from item 0 to item $N$. 
\item You can think of $i$ as an index into the sequence, in the same way you may think of $i$ as an index into an array. 
\item Usually, in 2301, the sequence being indexed is positive integers: 1,2,3,4 ... etc. So $x_1$ is usually 1, $x_2$ is usually 2, etc. You can assume we are indexing into the positive integers unless otherwise specified.
\item We write sigma notation in \LaTeX~as \verb|$ \Sigma_i=0^Nx_i $|
\end{itemize}

\begin{exmp}
You can also use summation notation without indexing into a sequence, e.g.\ $\Sigma_{n=1}^{N=3} (n+1) = (1+1) + (2+1) + (3 + 1) = 2 + 3 + 4$.
\end{exmp}

You can also use this notation to describe the sum of items in a sequence, after applying some operation.

\begin{exmp}
If $x=[1,2,3,4,5]$ then $\Sigma^5_{i=1} x_i^2 = 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 = 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 = 55$
\end{exmp}

\begin{exmp}
Note that you should read the $i$ as indexing into an array. So if you have an array $x=[2,3,4]$ then $\Sigma^3_{i=1} x_i = x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 2 + 3 + 4$
\end{exmp}


\subsection{Euclidean norm}

The Euclidean norm of a vector is  $\vert \vert x \vert \vert_2$ = $\sqrt{\Sigma_{i=1}^{N} x_i ^2}$. You can think of the Euclidean norm as the size of a vector. 
\begin{exmp}
If $ \mathbf{x}=<-2,2> $ then  $\vert \vert x \vert \vert_2$ = $\sqrt{-2^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{4 + 4}  = \sqrt{8}$  
\end{exmp}

\noindent Note: There are also other norms, which offer other ways of defining the size of a vector.

\subsection{Normalizing a vector}

\begin{itemize}
\item To normalize a vector, divide each component by the (Euclidean) norm. This creates a new ``unit vector'' with a norm of 1. 
\item People sometimes write unit vectors with ``hats'' over them, e.g.  $\hat{\bm{b}}$ (written \verb|$ \hat{\boldsymbol{b}} $|, where \verb|$ \boldsymbol $| means to write the symbol in bold).
\end{itemize}

\begin{exmp}
If $ \mathbf{x}=<-2,2> $ then  $\vert \vert x \vert \vert_2$ = $\sqrt{-2^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{4 + 4}  = \sqrt{8}$. The unit vector of $ \mathbf{x}$ is $ \mathbf{\hat{x}}=<\frac{-2}{\sqrt{8}},\frac{2}{\sqrt{8}}> $. The Euclidean norm of the unit vector is $\sqrt{(\frac{-2}{\sqrt{8}})^2 + (\frac{2}{\sqrt{8}})^2}$ = $\sqrt{\frac{4}{8} + \frac{4}{8}}$ = $1$, so you know you have a unit vector. 
\end{exmp}

\subsubsection{You can normalize any vector}
Any vector can be converted into a unit vector. Here is an argument for this claim in 2D. It is easy to extend to any dimension. It is OK to skip this part if you want to just trust that you can always normalize. Assume we have a Euclidean norm of $N$. The following is true by definition in 2D.

\begin{equation}
a^2 + b^2 = N^2 
\end{equation}

Divide each side by $N^2$

\begin{equation}
\frac{a^2}{N^2} + \frac{b^2}{N^2} = 1
\end{equation}

Take the root of each side

\begin{equation}
\sqrt{\frac{a^2}{N^2} + \frac{b^2}{N^2}} = \sqrt{1}
\end{equation}

Simplify, recalling that the square root of 1 is 1.

\begin{equation}
\sqrt{(\frac{a}{N})^2 + (\frac{b}{N})^2} = 1
\end{equation}

Therefore, by definition, if you divide each component by $N$ you get a normalized vector.

\subsection{Dot product}

There are two ways to think about the dot product. You can think about it geometrically (in pictures) or algebraically (in symbols). It's better to build geometric intuition than to plug and chug through the algebraic version, but both are important to know really well.

\begin{itemize}
\item Algebraically, the dot product is defined as $\bm{a} \cdot \bm{b}$  = $\sum_i \bm{a}_i \bm{b}_i$.
\item Geometrically, the dot product is defined as $\bm{a} \cdot \bm{b}$  = $ \vert\vert  \bm{a}  \vert\vert \text{ }   \vert\vert  \bm{b}  \vert\vert \text{ }  \text{cos }  \theta $. This follows from the fact that the dot product between two vectors $\bm{a} \cdot \bm{b}$ (the dot symbol is written \verb|$ \cdot $|) is defined as the projection of $\bm{a}$ onto $\hat{\bm{b}}$, the unit vector of $\bm{b}$. (The lecture included a brief derivation.) You can think of the projection as the shadow $\bm{a}$ casts onto $\hat{\bm{b}}$. Another way to think about the dot product is the extent to which $\bm{a}$ and $\bm{b}$ point in the same direction, given that they might have different sizes (norms).
When the angle between the vectors is acute, the dot product is positive. When it is obtuse the dot product is negative.
\end{itemize}

     \subfloat[][b]{\includegraphics[width=3cm]{dot_prod_oblique}\label{<figure2>}}
     \caption{The dot product is positive when the angle $\theta$ between $\bm{a}$  and $\hat{\bm{b}}$ is less than 90 degrees (left). It is zero when $\theta$ = $90^{\circ}$. It is negative when $\theta$ is greater than  $90^{\circ}$.}
     \label{steady_state}
\end{figure}

\begin{exmp}
If $ \mathbf{x}=<-2,2> $ and then $ \mathbf{y}=<-1,7> $ then $\bm{x} \cdot \bm{y}$ =  $\sum_i \bm{x}_i \bm{y}_i$ = $-2 * -1 + 2 * 7$ = 2 + 14 = 16
\end{exmp}

\section{Booleans}

A Boolean variable can take on the value True or False. A Boolean expression is a collection of Boolean variables, joined by logical operators.

\subsection{NOT}

The simplest Boolean operator is NOT. The NOT operator takes a single Boolean operand. It flips the value of the Boolean variable (so True becomes False, and vice versa.) For instance, $A$ might be Boolean variable equal to True. Then NOT A is False. We also write this as $\neg A$ (\verb|$ \neg $|).

\subsection{AND}
The Boolean operator AND takes two Boolean variables as operands. The operator returns True if both variables are True. We write this $ A \wedge B$ (\verb|$ A \wedge B $|)

\subsection{OR}
The Boolean operator OR takes two Boolean variables as operands. The operator returns True if either variables is True. We write this $ A \vee B$ (\verb|$ A \ve B $|)

\begin{exmp}
If $A$=True and $B$=True then  $ A \wedge B$ is True
\end{exmp}

\begin{exmp}
If $A$=True and $B$=False then  $ A \wedge B$ is False
\end{exmp}

\begin{exmp}
If $A$=True and $B$=False then  $ A \vee B$ is False
\end{exmp}

\begin{exmp}
If $A$=True and $B$=False then  $ A \wedge \neg B$ is True because $\neg B$ is True and the AND of two true variables is True
\end{exmp}

\subsection{Evaluation}

Evaluating a Boolean expression means determining if the expression is True or False, based on the values of its variables. To evaluate a Boolean expression you should fill in the value of each variable and simplify.

\begin{exmp}
If $A$=True and $B$=False and $C$=True then  $ (A \vee B) \wedge C$ = $ (T \vee F) \wedge T$ = $ T \wedge T = T$  
\end{exmp}

\section{Probability}

\subsection{The sample space}

The sample space $\Omega$  (written \verb|$\Omega$|) is the set of all outcomes of an experiment. An event $A$ is a subset of the sample space. 

\begin{exmp}
If we toss a coin twice then $\Omega$=$\{HH, HT, TH, TT\}$
\end{exmp}

\begin{exmp}
If we toss a coin twice then $\Omega$=$\{HH, HT, TH, TT\}.$ The event ``at least one tails'' is $A=\{HT, TH, TT\}$. Notice that $A \subset \Omega$.
\end{exmp}

\subsection{Probability distribution}

A probability distribution is a function that maps events to real numbers between 0 and 1, and that satisfies the following three properties

\begin{itemize}
\item $p(A) \geq 0$ for all $A$
\item $p(\Omega) = 1$
\item If $A$ and $A^\prime$ are disjoint (i.e. their intersection is $\emptyset$) then $p(A \cup A^{\prime}) =  p(A) + p(A^{\prime})$
\end{itemize}
