    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Research an application of Bayes rule on the Internet. There are hundreds and hundreds of applications of Bayes rule, and you will find that Bayes rule comes up in many interesting scenarios. It's OK to use a simple, toy application of Bayes rule if you want (e.g. $p(\\text{it will rain} |  \\text{it is cloudy outside})$. But you are highly encouraged to do a little bit of digging to discover some interesting application in an interesting area like bioinformatics, natural language processing or computer security. Bayes rule is everywhere! \n",

    "What to report: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Briefly describe the problem you found and why people use Bayes rule to solve it \n",
    "2. Describe the prior, the likelihood and evidence. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Sometimes people don't report the evidence because $p(B)$ is just a constant demoninator in the Bayes equation. So you might see something like $p(A|B) \\propto p(B|A)p(A)$ which means $p(A|B)$ is defined in proportion to $p(B|A)p(A)$ (ignoring the constant). If that happens in your application it is OK to not describe an equation for the evidence."
