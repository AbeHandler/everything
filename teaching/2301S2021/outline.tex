An outline of what we've covered so far. You should be comfortable with everything in this document.

\section{Sets}

A \textbf{set} is an unordered collection of items, without duplicates. 

People follow a number of conventions when talking about sets.

\begin{itemize}
    \item The items in a set are often called ``elements''
    \item We use capital letters to name sets
    \item We show the elements in a set using curly brackets
    \item A set can include any kind of element (e.g.\ strings, or kinds of apple)
\end{itemize}

\begin{exmp}
We can write the integers between 0 and 3 (including 0 and 3) as $A$ = $\{0,1,2,3\}$
\end{exmp}

\begin{exmp}
Because sets do not have order, if $ B= \{0,1\}$ and $C=\{1,0\}$, then $C=B$.
\end{exmp}

\begin{exmp}
A set of strings, $ P= \{ \text{\say{Denver},\say{Boulder},\say{Broomfield}} \}$
\end{exmp}

\begin{itemize}
    \item If $a$ is an element in $X$ then, we use the notation $a \in X$ 
    \item If $a \in X$ then we say that ``$a$ is in $X$''
    \item We write this: \verb|$a \in X$|
    \item If $a \notin X$ then we say that ``$a$ is not in $X$''
    \item We write this: \verb|$a \notin X$|
\end{itemize}

\begin{exmp}
Let $ C= \{1, 2\}$. Then $1 \in C$ and $6 \notin C$
\end{exmp}


\subsection{Subsets}

If all elements of $A$ are elements of $B$ then we say that $A$ is a subset of $B$.  We use the notation $ A \subset B$ (written \verb|$ A  \subset B $|) to indicate that $A$ is a subset of $B$.

\begin{exmp}\label{e:subset}
Let $ A= \{2, 1\}$ and $B = \{1,2,5\}$. Then $A \subset B$
\end{exmp}

In this class, when we use $ A \subset B$ we will assume that some elements of $B$ are not elements of $A$. So $A$ is a ``proper subset'' of $B$. For instance, in Example \ref{e:subset}, $A \subset B$ because $5 \in B$ and $5 \notin A$. If we want to allow for the possibility that $A=B$, we can use the notation $A \subseteq B$ (written \verb|$ A \subseteq B $|). 

\begin{exmp}
Let $ A= \{1, 2,3 \}$ and $B = \{1,2,3\}$. Then $A \subseteq B$ but not $A \subset B$
\end{exmp}

\begin{exmp}
Let $ A= \{1, 3 \}$ and $B = \{1,2,3\}$. Then $A \subseteq B$ and $A \subset B$
\end{exmp}

\subsection{Intersections, unions and complements}

\begin{itemize}

\item We use the notation $A \cap B$ (written \verb|$ A  \cap B $|) to indicate all of the elements that are in \textit{both} $A$ and $B$. This is called the \textit{intersection} of $A$ and $B$

\item We use the notation $A \cup B$ (written \verb|$ A  \cup B $|) to indicate all of the elements that are in $A$ or $B$. This is called the \textit{union} of $A$ and $B$.

\item To understand intersections and unions it is often helpful to draw venn diagrams. 

\end{itemize}

\begin{exmp}
Let $ A= \{1, 2, 3\}$ and $B = \{2,3,7\}$. Then $A \cap B$ = $\{2, 3\}$ and $A \cup B$ = $\{1,2, 3, 7\}$
\end{exmp}

\begin{itemize}
\item The complement of a set $A$ is the set of all elements that are not in $A$
\item The complement of a set requires defining $U$, the universal set of all possible elements
\item We write the complement of $A$ as $\overline{A}$ (written \verb|$ \overline{A} $| 
\item We can also write the complement as $A^c$  (written \verb|$ A^c $|)
\end{itemize}

\begin{exmp}
Let $ U= \{1, 2, 3\}$ and $A = \{2\}$. Then $\overline{A}$ = $\{1, 3\}$ 
\end{exmp}

\subsection{Cardinality}

The number of items in a set is called the \textit{cardinality} of the set. We use the notation $\vert F \vert$ (written \verb|$ \vert F \vert $|) to indicate the cardinality of a set.

\begin{exmp}
Let $ F = \{1, -2, 42 \}$, then $\vert F \vert$ = 3
\end{exmp}

\section{Vectors}

\begin{itemize}
\item A vector is a list of numbers. 
\item Each number in the vector is called a ``component'' and represents a dimension of the vector. 
\item We denote vectors with bold, lower-case letters and triangle brackets, such as $ \mathbf{x}=<1,2> $ (written \verb|$  \mathbf{x}=<1,2> $|)
\item We can use subscripts to refer to components of a vector. If $\mathbf{x}=<6,9>$ then $\mathbf{x}_1$ = 6 (assuming indexing starting at one)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Vector addition}

Vector addition is an operation which takes two input vectors and returns one output vector. If  $\mathbf{x}=<x_1, x_2 ... x_n>$ and $\mathbf{y}=<y_1, y_2 ... y_n>$  then  $\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{y}=<x_1 + y_1, x_2 + y_2 ... x_n + y_n>$.

\begin{exmp}
$\mathbf{x}=<3,4>$ and $\mathbf{y}=<-1,2>$  then  $\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{y}=<2,6>$
\end{exmp}
