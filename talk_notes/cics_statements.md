#### Faculty job statements

- CICS panel 4/30/21 on Zoom covering faculty statements 

Research statement should introduce committee to the field. Like a job talk. They might not know anything about your area. Sddress a broad audience. It is OK to use "I" in a statement, not we.

#### MI
- Letters of Rec is most important
- Then comes research statement
- Convince people that your prior work is important and has a good future in the field. Leave one page for a future vision. Talk about your PAST work; what you have done.
- OK to brag about your work
- Use whitespace, bolding, etc. to help people skim your statement. They read a lot of these

#### LT
- Don't focus on next year. What are you doing for the next five years? Where are you going for the long haul?
- Teaching statement should say what you want to teach, and are teaching.
- Cover letter should be short. Not long. Say why are excited about this place (e.g. have family in area)
- Consider adding sample assignments 

### Diversity statement
- What counts as evidence? You can't just say you are good at something or care about something. You have to show that you do them. 
- If you feel uncomfortable about your diversity statement
- Diversity in access to research (e.g. talks and outreach) 
- Diversity in background? 
- What did you do to make students welcome in OO? 
- What did you do to help all students succeed?
- How do you support different learning styles?
- It is OK to keep it small and tight.
- Could talk about blogging for INFO majors.

### Length 
- Keep all statements less than four pages. Use formatting etc. People won't read long stuff.

### Looking for advice online
- Look at statements from others
- But we wary of too much advice. 
- Feel free to reach out to CICS for writing advice 
- MIT COMM Kit has good resources
