Next year. Spring? 2301, capstone, Q?. Do something not on the schedule. 

zoom meeting w/ rb

### Data and the humanities 
Never been offered. Put on the books. Involved in campus creation of grad cert in digital humanities. Grad/undergrad cross list. Do more in digital humanities realm. People in humanities want. Not going to come from CS. Donâ€™t have to decide this now. An interesting cross section of students. Doing more digital hum in history department. CRDDs. A hub in digital humanities. Interesting bunch of students. Help w/ stuff want to do. 

### 3401++
Electives are all much more on the qual side. 

A possible next step from 3401. 3401+ Cover stuff like: power, significance, regression, clustering. Data science for information science? Advanced quantitative information science? 3401+ elective? 

Try applying it as a topics class. Fixed course number. That allows you to offer whatever you want w/ no course number. Fairness + bias in AI. If you want something in the catalog. It has a course number. Then you need to go through a process. Offer it for the first time. 4871 header. Prereqs. Coming up with the course. What is the niche for it? 3401 required. 

There is the possibility of more quant stuff. There is undergrad interest and maybe more grad interest. Robin offered data science for information science. PhD students only. A class that is along those lines. The students who took it had no stats.

### Other ideas
Software engineering for data centered systems? That is the next step along the software realm. 

InfoViz. Need that one back. Not there yet. 
Programming. Not programming every semester.
