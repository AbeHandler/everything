Got OpenCCG working and figured out how to parse. See `openccg/notes.txt` and `openccg/setup.md` 
thought about how to apply openCCG for our problem. see `notes/`
added steedman's CCG tutorial to zotero. 
The openCCG software cites mid to late augts ACL papers from baldrige and others explaining how it does realization, parsing, etc
