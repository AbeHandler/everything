### Reiter and Dale, Applied NLG systems 

##### Breaks NLG down into six tasks
1. Content determination (what is communicated?)
2. Discourse planning. Make a tree of what you are tring to communicate and how the messages are grouped together
3. Sentence aggregation. Group messages into sentences.
4. Lexicalization: which words do you use to communicate the deeper concepts
5. referring expression generation. Seems to mean which pronouns 
6. linguistic realization. use grammer to produce syntaxtically, morphologically and orthographically correct grammar


###### Pipeline
In practice, they say that people do a 3-stage pipeline. 
Text planning (content determination and discourse planning) -> text plan
text plan -> Sentence planning: aggregation, lexicalation and referring expression generation 
-> then linguistic realization

###### Intermediate representation

1. Text plan is usually a tree
2. Sentence plans describe how words in sentence are related. Less applicable for us
3. You could also have a way of representing a sentence abstractly. Like what does it say?
