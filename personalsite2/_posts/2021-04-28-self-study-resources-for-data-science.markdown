Many CU INFO majors ask me for resources for learning data science. Here is a list of some of my favorites. I've broken up this list into resources focused on math and stats, [machine learning concepts](#machine-learning-concepts), and programming.

### Math and stats

Data science is based on math and stats, so it makes sense to spend time continually deepening your understanding of these fundamental ideas. Also, while the field changes all the time, the underlying quantitative concepts (e.g. probability or linear algebra) will remain consistent. 

- **3blue1brown** is an AMAZING math YouTuber. I learn a ton from his videos, and am definitely inspired by the quality of his teaching. I also leaned on videos from **mathmonk** to build my quantitative background, especially during my first year in grad school. I suggest poking around to find a teaching style that works for you. 

- Wasserman's **All of Statistics**. This is a great book, that focuses on a terse and rigorous introduction to Statistics. It will definitely be a challenge to get started with this resource, but you will learn a lot if you put in the effort. (I think the title is a little bit of a joke.) 

- Zico Kolter has a good **[quick start](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~zkolter/course/15-884/linalg-review.pdf)** for linear algebra.

- I really like the [book](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/CASI/) **Computer Age Statistical Inference** to give an overall perspective on stats, but I would not start with this resource when you are getting started.

### Machine learning concepts

Machine learning is either [the same thing](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/6/the-two-cultures-statistics-vs-machine-learning) as statistics or somehow closely-related to statistics, depending on your perspective. Here are a few books to get started, more focused on ML.

- Packt's **Python Machine Learning (PML)**. This is the textbook for 4604. It offers a nice hands-on introduction to ML, with a focus on using and understanding Python ML libraries.  

- Kevin Murphy's **Machine Learning**. This is a standard graduate textbook in ML. It is much harder than Python Machine Learning (PML) and you will need to put in likely months of effort to get comfortable with the contents. But it offers a much deeper perspective on the field than PML. If you are serious about understanding the underlying details of ML, you will need to spend time working through resources with some mathematical depth. You donâ€™t need to read every chapter in Murphy all at once. Give yourself years to learn the material.

### Programming and tools

There are thousands if not tens of thousands of books, tutorials and online courses for learning how to code. Someone even made a [game](https://vim-adventures.com/) that teaches you to use VIM. With that said, here are a few scattered thoughts on how to navigate the landscape. 

- **Basic stuff to learn,** Tools and languages change all the time, and I am not sure it makes too much sense to get too focused on any particular tool or language. But with that said you will need to show some fluency with current tools to get started in your career. It is a good idea to learn how to use **PyTorch** or **tensorflow**, as well as to be comfortable with **pandas** and **scikit-learn**. I love the **tidyverse** for exploratory data analysis for small datasets (its a collection of R packages), and some people like **Julia** for writing performant code. **Altair** is nice for data visualization in Python, but there are many competitors like **matplotlib**.

- There are so many tools and systems out there it can be tricky to decide **where to focus your effort**. I can think of at least two strategies. One good option is to just follow your own curiosity. Learn what you want to learn to answer the kinds of questions you want to answer and take on the kinds of projects you'd like to complete! Alternately, I also think it also makes sense to be a bit analytic about what you study first. The **[programmer competency matrix](https://web.archive.org/web/20210417182641/https://sijinjoseph.com/programmer-competency-matrix/)** helped me a lot when I started working as a software developer without a CS degree. What I like about it is you can sort of see where you land on this matrix, and systematically fill gaps in your background. Of course, if you are interested in a particular role or job, definitely speak with people in that area to understand what you need to know.
