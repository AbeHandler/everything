<h5>Research</h5>

As a resesearcher, I am interested in user-facing natural language processing applications, especially new tools for searching, analyzing and making sense of large document collections.

As part of this work, I design and build [interfaces](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.01944.pdf) with collaborators from [HCI](https://www.cics.umass.edu/people/mahyar-narges), develop [algorithms](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D19-1612.pdf) for efficient summarization, and research [natural language processing techniques](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N18-1159.pdf) to support new ways of [analyzing text](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D19-5414.pdf). 

<h5>Teaching</h5>
I am very excited to be working as an instructor at the University of Colorado, Boulder, where I have been teaching remote courses during COVID. I am [cautiously optimistic](https://www.khanacademy.org/) about the possibilities of online eductation, and very interested in [technologies](https://github.com/AbeHandler/CanvasCLI) and [methods](https://projecteuler.net/) for effective, low-cost, online pedagogy at scale.

<h5>Industry</h5>
I started graduate school after working as a software developer and data journalist, and remain interested in applying computational methods in practical settings. I've worked as an intern for early-stage and late-stage startups, and like to listen to [podcasts](https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast) and read blogs about the [technology](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/) industry to follow new developments.
