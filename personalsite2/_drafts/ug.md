I speak to many undergrad INFO majors interested in data science, who often ask me for advice about the field. While you can find lots and lots of general advice on data science online, as an INFO instructor with a data background I can offer guidance which is better tailored to students taking INFO courses at CU. This post is to organize my thoughts in one place, instead of with scattered one-off emails. If you find it helpful or have any questions that are not covered here, please let me know!

Why do data science? 

Different people get into data science for different reasons. Some data scientists have PhDs in pure math, but want to move into something more practical. Others start out as software engineers without any specialized training, end up doing a lot of data work, and wind up on a data science team. Ultimately, you will have your own personal reasons for getting into working with data for a living. 

For, me, the best part of data work is how interdisciplinary it is. When I was an undergrad, I had a lot of trouble picking just one thing to study. I was interested in too many areas! Eventually I settled on working with computers and data once I began working because I realized these skills could be broadly applied towards many different things, and intersect with many different areas. For instance, JPEG compression ties together math, programming and human visual perception. It’s quite cool. 

If you have a background in data science and start out working for, say, an auto insurance company, you might use some of the same skills you pick up at work to then move to a totally different area, like doing analysis for a computer security firm. There is a famous quote from a statistician John Tukey that I really like. “The best part of being a data scientist is that you get to play in everyone’s back yard.” 

That said, this interdisciplinary attitude does have dangers. It is important to be aware that data science is not a master skill that trumps or supersedes the knowledge of domain experts. Your job as a data literate person is not to wander into strange areas and start pretending like you know everything because you can operate a classification library. Take time to learn about new fields so you can actually apply your knowledge in useful and appropriate ways. Data literacy is a powerful tool, but like any tool applying it well means taking time to learn what is actually going on, usually in collaboration with experts or following a bunch of research. For me, this is kind of the fun part! Someone once told me that when working a collaborator, they try to learn as much as the collaborator (on some narrow topic). I don’t always hit this high bar, but it is an admirable goal.

What is data science? 

Ha. I laugh because it’s kind of hard to pin down. I would personally say that data science is working with computational tools to analyze practical or domain-specific problems using data. In some contexts, I think data science is probably the same thing as statistics or machine learning. [links] But I really don’t want to get into a long discussion of how many angels fit onto the head of a pin. [link] For you, I think it is OK to think of data science as some sort of mix of programming, statistics and domain knowledge. There are plenty of people in specific domains who use computers to solve problems with data (e.g. public health experts, link TrevorB) but don’t call themselves “data scientists.” So I honestly would not get too focused on this particular label. If you like programming, math and learning new things, you can do fun and useful stuff if you call what you are doing “data science.” 

Is INFO a data science degree?

I would say no. As an INFO major, you will take classes like 2131 which are related to data science, but which do not directly emphasize math or computation. Many INFO students and INFO faculty (including me!) are also very interested in design and social science. While design and social science can and do often involve data and computation, I would say that design and social science are not quite the same thing as data science. 

So I think an INFO major is a great first step towards working with data for a living, but you will need a lot more study. See the sections What classes can I take for this at CU? and Self-study and  Do I need a masters to become a data scientist?.

What classes can I take for this at CU? 

Within INFO, the obvious choices are INFO 1111, INFO 2301, INFO 3401, INFO 3402 and INFO 4604. If you are majoring in INFO already, you will already take many of these classes as part of your major. 

INFO 4604 offers a hands-on introduction to machine learning using the Python library scikit-learn. The class provides a gentle introduction to fundamental concepts in machine learning such as regularization, classification and optimization, while also emphasizing more practical and complementary skills such as hyperparameter tuning and data collection. It's a good first class if you are curious about this area, and counts as an INFO elective.

That said, if you are serious about learning data science, I would strongly recommend supplementing your INFO classes with other courses during your time as an undergrad. INFO is a totally reasonable background for getting started in a career working with data. But you will need MUCH more study before you are ready to take on impactful data projects, or get hired for many data roles. 

With that said, you should definitely take more classes at CU to supplement your INFO education. I would take a look look at classes from math, stats and CS to start; anything that builds your computational or quantitative skills will be useful. If you are interested in a particular domain (e.g. business or sports or music), I would also strongly recommend also taking classes to build your knowledge in that particular area. Domain knowledge matters a lot. 
 
Note that classes in other departments may be harder than INFO courses, but that is fine. Focus on learning new stuff, not your GPA! If you show that you have mastered skills people need, they really won’t care if you did well or poorly in any given class. If you take a pure math class and don’t do so well but learn a lot, consider that a huge win!

Note: For many people, my anecdotal sense is that it helpful to have a BA. (That’s not an empirical claim.) But it is important to know you can also learn a ton without taking classes or being enrolled at a university. See the section on “Self study” below.

Career advice 

I am not really a hiring manager and so can’t pretend to know what companies are looking for from future data analysts or data scientists. A friend who works as a data scientist in industry recommends the book “….” Some INFO students have found this book to be helpful. I’ve heard that “data scientist” is also a bit vague, and people tend to specialize in a particular domain (e.g. sports), skillset (e.g. quantitative fundamentals) or kind of data (e.g. NLP).

If you are interested in a particular industry or particular role, I would suggest taking an empirical approach to career development. Go find people who just got jobs in that area (or who are in charge of hiring) and ask them for advice. Alternately, look at the CVs of people in jobs you might want in to 2 to 3 years, and then analytically try to fill gaps between your CV and their CV. (This advice comes from Vassil Roussev http://roussev.net/.)

Do I need a master's to become a data scientist? 

That’s a complex question, and I think the answer depends on many factors such as your skills, background, goals and financial position. I can definitely help you quantitative and computational understanding, but I am really not qualified to give you job advice. In general, I do personally think it is a good idea to work for a bit rather than go straight to grad school, because it helps you build up skills, gain a little bit of perspective on the world and also importantly earn some money. Once you are really sure what path you want to take, then I think it is great to take time to invest in learning more. You can also learn a ton of stuff for free from books and the Internet (see self study). So I would say consider your options, and try to really investigate free and low-cost resources, before you immediately jump into future formal study. That said, if you are really set on a particular path, and do a good job researching possible programs, it may be appropriate for you to just go ahead and continue straight to grad school.

Self-study 

Majoring in INFO is a totally reasonable choice for a person starting out in hopes of becoming a data analyst or data scientist. You get exposure to quantitative reasoning, develop elementary programming skills, get practice presenting conclusions from data, and learn to think critically and holistically about information systems. These is an awesome start! But you will need a lot more study before you are ready for many data roles. Here are some resources that might help.

Programming and tools

There are thousands if not tens of thousands of books, tutorials and even online courses for learning how to code. Someone even made a game that teaches you to use VIM. How do you decide where to focus your effort? The programmer competency matrix helped me a lot when I started working as a software developer without a CS degree. What I like about it is you can sort of see where you land on this matrix, and systematically fill gaps in your background. This is a great way to learn stuff. https://sijinjoseph.com/programmer-competency-matrix/. 

INFO students in the past have found data camp helpful.

Tools and languages change all the time, and I am not sure it makes too much sense to get too focused on any particular way of doing things. But with that said you will need to show some fluency with current tools to get started in your career. It is a good idea to learn how to use PyTorch or tensorflow, as well as to be comfortable with pandas or scikit-learn. I love the tidyverse (in the R language), and some people like Julia. I have seen some discussions about how maybe we will start doing ML in Swift. If you start searching around for data science software tools you can quickly disappear down a rabbit hole. It is a fun place to explore, but I would suggest not getting lost down there.

Math and stats
 
3blue1brown is an AMAZING math YouTuber. I learn a ton from his videos, and am definitely inspired by the quality of his teaching. I leaned on videos from mathmonk to build my quantitative background, especially during my first year in grad school. I suggest poking around to find a teach styles that works for you. 

Wasserman’s All of Statistics. This is a great book, that focuses on a terse and rigorous introduction to Statistics. It will definitely be a challenge to get started with this resource, but you will learn a lot if you put in the effort. (I think the title is a little bit of a joke.) 

Machine learning concepts

Machine learning is either the same thing as statistics or closely-related to statistics, depending on your perspective. https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/6/the-two-cultures-statistics-vs-machine-learning . Here are a few books to get started.
