# Fixed 

p0. added. Section \ref{s:system} includes a full system description, with an explanation of each lettered interface component shown above. 
p2. prior study -> prior work. changed.

p2. lexical connotations -> this was cut in last week or so. I dont think there is a real need to define the term "lexical query intent" do removted it

p3. relative to token length of doc -> this was cut in last week or so

p17 Shorten and mention limitation. Many search interfaces \cite{Handler17, expedition, TimeExplorer} include such time series plots (Figure \ref{f:time_series_plus_family}), but do not include navigable rug points.
This novel \ours~feature is only possible because we assume \ours~users work with smaller corpora, allowing every single document containing the query to be shown as one rug point on the plot.

p19. space? There is a yellow box too faint to see when printed out. Others may print out paper. I guess we could/should add boxes/borders around the colors? Added to my list 

p21. fixed stuff. reagan bolding and specify assumptions of compression methods
p22. in addition to tree algo or in addition? added clarification
p22. don't say enumerate. changed this to "search over". 
p22. Describe the algo more abstractly, then say K=2. OK. I describe it as searching over possible output and selecting the best. Then get into K=2 later b/c of latency

# Questions 

p1. current draft has comma before Amherst, which is I think what comment is about. If so this was fixed since the version you were looking at. Let me know if I misunderstood comment. 

p15. Changed to => prior work in HCI (e.g.\ SMILY \cite{smiley}) assumes that in order to earn user trust, a system must both have the capacity to help the user and the integrity to adhere to principles which are important in a given domain.

The version you were looking at cited an article from business literature from Mayer called "trust triples" that I sometimes see cited in HCI. I cut this cite. Curious appropriate way to cite Mayer trust triples, if at all. This article says to gain trust (in organizations) you need to have capacity, benevolence and integrity. I think including the cite is maybe good b/c it draws connections w/ Mayer? But also if they read SMILY they will find Mayer that way.

p17. Just cite the R language? That seems too confusing. I am wary of citing "statistical models in S" b/c I can't actually track down a copy to know what it says. Perhaps just drop this. 

p22. Cant read writing corresponding to "over three time steps" I crossed out the 'over 3 time steps'. I think comment says delete

p24. Cant fully read this comment but I think it suggests describing how expert interview relates to needfinding. Added a sentence to remind reader.

p25. Can't fully read the comment here. The review of HCI literature cited in that paragraph says:  
"These tensions may be explained by the subtle differences between agreement (where two or more
coders reconcile differences through discussion) versus establishing reliability (where two or
more coders independently apply the same code to a unit of text)." That distinction is not the main idea in the review of literature however. 

p25 suggested deleted line. Don't understand reason for deletion.

p29. Say is limitations that ??? this. Cant read ???
