# Fixed 

p0. added. Section \ref{s:system} includes a full system description, with an explanation of each lettered interface component shown above. 
p2. prior study -> prior work. changed.

p2. lexical connotations -> this was cut in last week or so. I dont think there is a real need to define the term "lexical query intent" do removted it

p3. relative to token length of doc -> this was cut in last week or so

p17 Shorten and mention limitation. Many search interfaces \cite{Handler17, expedition, TimeExplorer} include such time series plots (Figure \ref{f:time_series_plus_family}), but do not include navigable rug points.
This novel \ours~feature is only possible because we assume \ours~users work with smaller corpora, allowing every single document containing the query to be shown as one rug point on the plot.

p19. space? There is a yellow box too faint to see when printed out. Others may print out paper. I guess we could/should add boxes/borders around the colors? Added to my list 

p21. fixed stuff. reagan bolding and specify assumptions of compression methods

# Questions 
### p1

current draft has comma before Amherst. I think this is standard convention. Hard to tell what this comment refers to.

p15. Changed to => prior work in HCI (e.g.\ SMILY \cite{smiley}) assumes that in order to earn user trust, a system must both have the capacity to help the user and the integrity to adhere to principles which are important in a given domain.

Curious appropriate way to cite Mayer trust triples, if at all. This is a management science article that is cited in HCI that says to gain trust (in organizations) you need to have capacity, benevolence and integrity. I cut the cite from the above. I think including the cite is maybe good b/c it draws connections w/ Mayer but if they read SMILY they will find Mayer that way.

p17. Just cite the R language? That seems too confusing. I am wary of citing "statistical models in S" b/c I can't actually track down a copy to know what it says.
