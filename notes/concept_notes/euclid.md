One way to think about Euclidean distance, based on 2301 teaching

Euclidean distance is the straight line distance between two points. What is this? It is a vector from one vector head (vector $\bm{a}$) to the head of another (vector $\bm{b}$). Let $\bm{c}$ be the vector from $\bm{a}$ to $\bm{b}$. Then $\bm{a} + \bm{c} = \bm{b}$ so $\bm{c} = \bm{a} - \bm{b}$. If we take the magitude of $\bm{c}$ (i.e. the size of the vector) we have $\sqrt{\bm{a} - \bm{b}}$, i.e. the formula for Euclidean distance
