Spoke w/ MLFL visitor S. Rush. Suggested that we think about how to design models to support visualization and not the other way around. which is interesting.

- Latent variable + deep models might be safer

- I think the big selling point for his approach: you can do all of the black box probe tasks you want. Those papers are cool. But a certain point to actually deploy these things safely and reliably in the actual world you will need to control the model. Deep + latent seem better at this than black box NN.
