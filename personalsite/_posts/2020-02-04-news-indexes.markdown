I found out about a fun, old-school data structure in the UMass library yesterday.  Print indexes to news archives! These are physical books with pointers to (microfilm?) news. The indexes themselves include summary information, and so can be read as topical overviews, as well as pointers to relevant news stories. Here is the entry for Northampton Bridge, precursor to the bridge I cross every week https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_Coolidge_Bridge. (Does it make sense to try to construct such resources computationally? They are mentioned as useful resources in guides to archives for historians. https://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/polisci/faculty/trachtenberg/methbk/AppendixII.html#press)

Here are a bunch of fun pictures.  

Behold, the library. 

An index is both a pointer to source documents and a summary of what they contain. I am not sure how people follow such pointers. (How do they?)

UMass has all kinds of interesting indexes

- An index to the National Observer, a once weekly national newspaper published by Dow Jones. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Observer_(United_States).
- An index to editorials in the People's Daily
- An index to victorian periodicals
- An index to the Virginia Gazette https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Virginia_Gazette
- An index to newspapers from Cuba. 
- An index to the New York Times Index, organized by person. That is, a second order Index.
